1
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,792
<i>Love is like an ocean.</i>

2
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,250
<i>It is deep and profound.</i>

3
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,208
<i>You cannot conquer it.</i>

4
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,125
<i>You can only feel its intensity.</i>

5
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,208
<i>It could either feel chaotic or peaceful.</i>

6
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,000
<i>Chaotic, for the ones
who don't understand it.</i>

7
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,208
<i>Peaceful, for the ones</i>

8
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:45,625
<i>who are separated by
time and circumstances,</i>

9
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,708
<i>but nothing can keep them apart.</i>

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,917
<i>Kabir, the Indian poet and saint</i>

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,583
<i>had said that</i>

12
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:56,583
<i>nothing ever remains the same.</i>

13
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,000
<i>Saint Kabir also said that</i>

14
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,042
<i>time and tide wait for none.</i>

15
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:08,375
<i>Humans are never satisfied.</i>

16
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,625
<i>Plans are bound to fail.</i>

17
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:16,000
<i>Life is unpredictable.</i>

18
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,375
When Kabir was young

19
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,333
he had a favorite doll.

20
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:31,750
He loved that doll and
carried it with him at all times.

21
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,583
One morning I woke up
to a lot of commotion.

22
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,083
His doll was nowhere to be found.

23
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:43,167
He kept crying all day.
He neither ate, nor slept.

24
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:48,375
That's when I told him about Saint Kabir.

25
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,083
And here's what he had to say.

26
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:53,417
"Grandma, my doll is very smart."

27
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,625
I'm sure she is somewhere around.

28
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,750
Come with me right now.

29
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,958
Come on!

30
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,417
"We'll look for her."

31
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,583
Children have a clear logic.

32
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,833
He simply said, "Hope is good."

33
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,042
It's been 80 days
since he left home, Dad.

34
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:21,667
We can't sit around not knowing
where he is and what he's up to.

35
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,583
I don't care about him.

36
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,750
His was a great love story, isn't it?

37
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,583
What happened?

38
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,333
It's been 82 days since
I threw him out of the house.

39
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,250
And remember this.

40
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,583
If a person is obsessed with something,

41
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,042
he is sure to be disappointed.

42
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,958
That's the case with your brother.

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,083
Shankar, please start the bike.

44
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:05,667
Wow!

45
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,167
Stupid!

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,042
That's my nightgown,
not a bedsheet.

47
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,583
Give it to me.

48
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,792
<i>Listen up, youngsters.</i>

49
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,750
<i>Don't fall in love.</i>

50
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:16,708
<i>Listen up,
youngsters Don't fall in love</i>

51
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:20,333
<i>I lost my peace of mind.</i>

52
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,792
<i>After falling in love.</i>

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,375
That's not how it comes off.

54
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,792
Why is he singing?

55
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,125
I only need a couple of minutes.

56
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,458
Not right now! Please leave.

57
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,792
<i>Love is like an incurable disease.</i>

58
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:17,875
<i>Sing with me,</i> "Om Shanti Om".

59
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,625
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

60
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,250
I'll text you the address.
Come over right now.

61
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,208
<i>Why, sir?</i>

62
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,708
I'll meet you at the seminar hall.

63
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,750
Wider.

64
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,875
Hold on.

65
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,083
- Hello.
<i>- Shiva, listen to me.</i>

66
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,750
Do you remember that girl
I met at your clinic?

67
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,542
She was asking about me.

68
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,375
She thinks I'm handsome.

69
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,125
Her name is Shipra.
She's a family friend.

70
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,083
Will she come over to my place?

71
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,375
Please don't do this.

72
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,917
It's very awkward.

73
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,167
Answer my question.
Will she come over to my place?

74
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,250
She has a boyfriend.

75
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,208
<i>They are going to get married.</i>

76
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,542
Please try to understand.

77
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,958
Just answer the question.
Will she come over to my place?

78
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,417
You are ridiculous.

79
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,875
Are you slowly succumbing to your lust?

80
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,125
<i>- Will this help you forget Preeti?</i>
- Shut up.

81
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,167
What the hell have you done?
You peed on the seat!

82
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,792
My diaper is overflowing.

83
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,417
Do you wear a diaper?

84
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,167
Do you?

85
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,333
Don't you know when you have to pee?

86
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,375
Get lost!

87
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,542
Preeti.

88
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,667
Preeti.

89
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,708
Preeti.

90
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,125
What are you eating?
Open your mouth.

91
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,792
Is that chicken?

92
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,625
Spit it out.

93
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,792
Spit it out, Preeti.

94
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,292
Sir, dogs love eating chicken.

95
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:38,042
Pushpa, I've said it before.
Don't call her a dog.

96
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,917
Does she bother you in any way?

97
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,167
I clean up after her.
What's your problem?

98
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,875
Preeti, spit the chicken out.

99
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,518
You're not used to eating chicken.
It will upset your stomach.

100
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:49,875
Why did you eat it?

101
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,125
Sir, is she really going to speak?

102
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,875
Yes.

103
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,333
There's no way she's
going to reply to you.

104
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,458
Hey!

105
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,625
I'll shut that trap of yours for good!

106
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,292
Get out.

107
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,000
She's laughing at us.

108
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:17,042
Rani, we have a four-hour surgery
scheduled for today.

109
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:19,333
Be very alert about all the equipment.

110
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,833
I don't want to get yelled at.

111
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,125
Listen carefully, sir.

112
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,583
The skin heals on its own after a cut.

113
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,542
Similarly, the bone heals on its own.

114
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:02,000
It wasn't plastered properly
the last time you had a fracture.

115
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,875
It's healed, but in an angular direction.

116
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,333
That's causing you the pain.

117
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:10,542
I'll simply take the excess out
and align it back

118
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,958
using screws and plates.

119
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,042
All right?

120
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,375
You're operating on my leg.

121
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,125
Why did you have to shave me down there?

122
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,875
I hope you're handy with the knife.

123
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,125
I did, sir.

124
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,333
The cleanup is important, sir.

125
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,512
For example, in cricket, a cleanup
of the entire ground is necessary,

126
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,958
not just the pitch.

127
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,750
Don't worry. Just relax.

128
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,208
Rani, get the patient on
bed number 18 to the OT.

129
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,292
His astrologer says that today is
not a good day for the surgery.

130
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,750
He wants to get it done tomorrow.

131
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,250
So, what do we do?

132
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,250
Tell him that his upper thighs
are swollen.

133
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,958
If he doesn't act fast,
the swelling will spread up there.

134
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,417
Tell him that I'm crazy
and I'll just cut it off.

135
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,333
Rani, start the preparations
for the surgery.

136
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,083
The MO said that your
patient count is too high.

137
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,750
He won't enter it in the logbook.

138
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,917
Do as you please.

139
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
<i>Delhi Institute of Medical Science versus
Khalsa Institute of Medical Science.</i>

140
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,875
<i>Amit Sharma,
captain of the Khalsa institute.</i>

141
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,958
<i>Kabir Rajdheer Singh,
captain of the DIMS institute.</i>

142
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,083
Any other wounds?

143
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,208
Wait... Hold on.

144
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,833
Be careful about your privates.

145
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,458
The skin is sensitive to alcohol.

146
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,333
Otherwise, you'll have to
use an ice pack over it.

147
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,083
What kind of medicos are you?

148
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,167
- Is this your first aid kit?
- Yes.

149
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,667
I am full of shit, anyway.

150
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,476
If I had known that
he's going to get alcohol

151
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,708
I would've brought some bites.

152
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,125
Shut up. Pass me the cigarette.

153
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,958
- Here.
- Are you out of your mind?

154
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,625
Sohail.

155
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,875
Break his jaw!

156
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,458
Really?

157
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,625
Go ahead and try.

158
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,042
And if you manage to do it,

159
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,667
I'll strip naked and dance for you
at Connaught Place.

160
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,292
Asshole!

161
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,417
- Yes!
- Bravo!

162
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,750
Kabir!

163
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,833
Asshole!

164
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,583
- Stop!
- Come on, asshole!

165
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,708
Please stop it!

166
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,208
- Stop it!
- Let him go!

167
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,167
Stop hiding behind him!

168
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,125
Three more minutes,
and the trophy is all ours.

169
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,667
He's instigating you.

170
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,458
These guys have bribed the referee.

171
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,875
Forget it.

172
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,292
Calm down.

173
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,667
<i>The match is very exciting!</i>

174
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,417
<i>The ball has been passed!</i>

175
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,792
<i>It's a goal!</i>

176
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,458
Hey, Amit.

177
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:35,833
Three more minutes,
and we'll be the champions again!

178
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,417
Shiva.

179
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,667
Kabir!

180
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,917
- Kabir!
- Kabir!

181
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,167
Look!

182
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,333
Kabir?

183
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,500
Kamal!

184
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,542
Close the gate for me, please.

185
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,625
Don't spare him!

186
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,958
Beat him up!

187
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,042
Break his nose!

188
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,750
Break his face!

189
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,125
Hey!

190
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,208
Keep that on the table!

191
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,208
Do you know who he was?

192
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,792
The convener of
Delhi State Football Federation.

193
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,792
He got scared when you yelled at him.

194
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:44,042
Bloody wimp!

195
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,083
What did you expect?

196
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,250
The trophy belongs to us.

197
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,208
How does it feel like
to be a part of a college

198
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,417
that has a 100-year-old tradition?

199
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,167
He's one of our in-house surgeons.

200
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,833
When it comes to anger management...

201
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,167
He's a classic example
for all of you.

202
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:48,167
In the medical profession,
if a man cannot control his anger,

203
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,458
he's just a murderer with
a surgical blade in his hand.

204
00:19:55,542 --> 00:20:00,625
Anger, hatred, the rush of blood,
and an adrenaline rush.

205
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,792
It's pretty natural to
feel all these things.

206
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:07,292
But you need to ignore these emotions
and try to control them.

207
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,917
Without compassion,
this degree is of no use.

208
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,750
A low academic score
is acceptable to me.

209
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,875
But a zero in anger management...

210
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:24,208
Sir, we have a video
of the entire match.

211
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,708
You can check it.

212
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,417
Keep your post analysis to yourself
and please get out.

213
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:33,417
Get out, Shiva.
Please continue, sir.

214
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,458
Have you thought about
the college's reputation?

215
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,500
Write an apology letter
to the sports board.

216
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,500
And another to the college,
addressed to me.

217
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,625
I want the photocopies pinned up on
the noticeboard, with your signature.

218
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,458
Or, you can quit college.

219
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,125
Infiltrating the opponent's space.

220
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,667
Stopping the opponent from scoring a goal.

221
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,458
That's the only game
I understand, sir.

222
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,917
Don't talk about the rules.

223
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,125
I am just talking about my reservations.

224
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,208
The game commands
a sense of self-respect.

225
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,958
It invokes a warlike feeling.

226
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,042
I am a loyal student of this college.

227
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,750
I did whatever I had to
for this college.

228
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,333
Maybe I went overboard.

229
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,542
I cannot stay quiet.

230
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:30,042
I don't want to be tamed.
Not just on the field, but also in life.

231
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,542
What about your violent nature?

232
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,458
It is quite satisfying.

233
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,333
The satisfaction is far greater than
the fear of losing the championship.

234
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:43,000
I could have controlled my anger,
but that is not me.

235
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,833
I am not going to beg in front of you.

236
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,750
I don't owe you an explanation
and you don't want one either.

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,417
I quit.

238
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,000
Do you really want to quit college?

239
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,875
How will this anger benefit you
in the long run?

240
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,667
You won't understand, sir.

241
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,333
Have you decided to quit college?

242
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,417
Just write an apology letter.

243
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,167
All right.

244
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,167
You'll have to wait for two hours.

245
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,667
Ladies!

246
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,167
Listen to me carefully.

247
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,375
I am not going to
repeat this in English.

248
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,708
She shouldn't get a hint of this.

249
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:38,000
There's a new girl in college.

250
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:40,583
She's mine.

251
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:46,208
If anyone tries to impress her...

252
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,750
I will not spare that person.

253
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,000
Don't you dare...

254
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,667
- What's the Punjabi word for "hobby"?
- Interest.

255
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,750
Interest.

256
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,500
Don't you dare show any interest
in her hobbies.

257
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,083
Otherwise, you will end up in bandages.

258
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Her name...

259
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,333
She is dressed in white,
with a pink stole.

260
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,750
It's easy to spot her.

261
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,083
Got it?

262
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:14,708
You can woo any other girl.

263
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,750
But don't try to outsmart me.

264
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,292
There'll be new girls in college
every year.

265
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:23,833
You will have many options.

266
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,417
Don't sulk.

267
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,583
The teacher might get suspicious.

268
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:30,167
He is threatening us.

269
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,958
Hey!

270
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,750
This is just a warning, not a threat.

271
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:41,708
Kapil, where are all the girls?

272
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:45,167
They didn't show up because there
was no water supply at the hostel.

273
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,458
Pass my message to them.

274
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,417
And also, to those who
don't understand Punjabi.

275
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,833
I won't go around repeating the
same thing in every class.

276
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:22,958
The one dressed in white.

277
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:24,625
That's her.

278
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,083
- She's nice.
- She's very nice!

279
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,458
Don't embarrass her. Let's go.

280
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,750
Go ahead.

281
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,750
The girl dressed in white.

282
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:50,875
What's your name?

283
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,250
Preeti.

284
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:54,292
Preeti Sikka.

285
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:55,542
Sikka?

286
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:56,625
Are you from Delhi?

287
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,667
200 kilometers away.

288
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,625
What's her name?

289
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,042
Please tell him your name.

290
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,708
Preeti.

291
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,208
Sit down.

292
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,125
Yes, Dad.

293
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:26,750
Our manager's niece has
joined your college today.

294
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,042
Your college is known for ragging.

295
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,083
<i>And he's worried sick.</i>

296
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,208
He's right next to me.

297
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,167
Don't worry, I'll take care of her.

298
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,292
Ask him about the football match.

299
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,500
What about the football match?

300
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:46,000
I got into trouble.

301
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,500
I beat the guy up.

302
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,625
Were you suspended?

303
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,792
<i>Only for a month.</i>

304
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:52,000
The college will send you a formal letter.

305
00:28:58,833 --> 00:28:59,667
Hey!

306
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,708
You entered her classroom, didn't you?

307
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,875
I think she complained
to her father about it.

308
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,583
He's been asking around the OPD for you.

309
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,417
- So what?
- You're already suspended.

310
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,500
Stop getting into trouble.
Shiva, you deserve a slap for this.

311
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,183
Why don't you knock some sense into him?

312
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:16,583
Kamal.

313
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,333
Is that him?

314
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,417
Kabir, he doesn't know you.

315
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:25,625
Don't get into this.

316
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,750
Kabir, she's with him.

317
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:34,667
Wait.

318
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,292
I am Kabir Singh. What's wrong?

319
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,042
It's reckless for a doctor to be smoking.

320
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,000
I know, but I am addicted to it.

321
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:59,208
Does your father know about this?

322
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,792
No. But I won't lie to him
if he questions me.

323
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:04,917
I am Harpal Sikka.

324
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,667
My cousin works for your father.

325
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,667
I had called him up.

326
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,125
Oh! Hello, uncle.

327
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:13,750
Dad asked me to take care of her.

328
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,708
She's Preeti, my daughter.

329
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:20,167
Take care of her, like a brother.

330
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,500
I don't have a sister.

331
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:28,083
I might slap her if she doesn't study.

332
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,750
My daughter is a rank holder.

333
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:41,458
Are you from the management quota?

334
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,167
I like the winters in Delhi,
that's why I came to this college.

335
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,750
See you, uncle.

336
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,042
Let's go.

337
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,792
Do you need invitation cards?

338
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:08,583
Don't be embarrassed.

339
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,750
Is everyone here?

340
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:17,708
Don't waste my time.
Just take your clothes off.

341
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,667
You heard it right.
Take your clothes off.

342
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:25,792
What's wrong? Are you deaf?

343
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:28,958
What's wrong?

344
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:32,125
You think you're special?

345
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,708
This is how we do it in DIMS.

346
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Come on.

347
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:41,333
We belong to traditional families.

348
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:44,875
What was that?

349
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,708
Do you keep your undies on
while bathing?

350
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,000
You'll have to strip for us.

351
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:54,167
The sooner you do it, the better.

352
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:55,667
Come on, take them off.

353
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,833
It's just us girls.

354
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:02,958
I haven't waxed.

355
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:05,458
What's going on?

356
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:10,750
Save the awkwardness
for your wedding night.

357
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,583
Come on, take your clothes off.

358
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:15,458
Who is Preeti Sikka?

359
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,083
Who are you?

360
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,125
Kabir is interested in her.

361
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,083
He has warned everyone.

362
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,500
If you trouble her,
you will have to bear the consequences.

363
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,083
Let's go, Preeti.

364
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,917
That's not fair.

365
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,083
He was about to quit college.

366
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,750
He changed his mind because of her.

367
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,958
I wonder what's so special about her.

368
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:38,958
We didn't get to find that out.

369
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:49,417
<i>When I met you</i>

370
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:54,292
<i>I felt like.</i>

371
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,292
<i>All my dreams have come true.</i>

372
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:04,375
<i>Sweetheart.</i>

373
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,333
<i>You and I are one soul.</i>

374
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:19,167
<i>We shall always be together.</i>

375
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:33,000
Do you like the campus?

376
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,458
Do you like the food in the mess?

377
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,667
Were you playing <i>Antakshari?</i>

378
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:52,833
Did your father leave?

379
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,542
Oh, God!

380
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:10,625
It's okay.

381
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,542
We didn't see it coming.

382
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,042
Her father was here in the morning.

383
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,208
No one saw that.

384
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:47,500
<i>I can't stop smiling
Every time I see you</i>

385
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:50,125
<i>I wonder why.</i>

386
00:34:53,417 --> 00:35:01,417
<i>There's a change In my attitude.</i>

387
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:10,583
<i>Everywhere I look I
only wish to see you.</i>

388
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:15,417
<i>Is this really me?</i>

389
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,042
<i>Or is this someone else?</i>

390
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:22,458
<i>Someone else who looks like me.</i>

391
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:30,292
Preeti, this is a very crucial degree.

392
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,167
What were you doing back there?

393
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,667
Shruti, Preeti.

394
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,000
Preeti, Shruti.

395
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:13,958
She's your friend now.

396
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:15,708
And your roommate.

397
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,208
Okay.

398
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,208
Whose lecture do you have today?

399
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:25,458
Professor Kulkarni's.

400
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,250
I am studying the same topic
for my master's.

401
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,042
I'll revise the basics.

402
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,750
Let's go.

403
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:49,500
<i>How did it happen?</i>

404
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,750
<i>How did you become my necessity?</i>

405
00:36:55,083 --> 00:37:00,125
<i>How did it happen?</i>

406
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:05,167
<i>How did you become my necessity?</i>

407
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:10,500
<i>How did it happen?</i>

408
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:15,208
<i>How did you become my necessity?</i>

409
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,667
What is today's topic?

410
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:36,542
Come on.

411
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:48,083
<i>Wandering from place to place
Day and night.</i>

412
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:55,583
<i>Unable to tether
anywhere But your eyes.</i>

413
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:59,167
<i>Tell me to stay.</i>

414
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:05,042
<i>What is happening to me?</i>

415
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:08,625
Today's topic?

416
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:25,750
<i>Everywhere I look</i>

417
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:33,667
<i>I only wish to see
you Is this really me?</i>

418
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:36,583
<i>Or is this someone else?</i>

419
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:41,000
<i>Someone else who looks like me.</i>

420
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:48,083
<i>How did it happen?</i>

421
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:53,167
<i>How did you become my necessity?</i>

422
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:58,542
<i>How did it happen?</i>

423
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:03,708
<i>How did you become my necessity?</i>

424
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,125
<i>How did it happen?</i>

425
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:14,167
<i>How did you become my necessity?</i>

426
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:01,417
Call her.

427
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,833
That's the way you've always been.

428
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:05,708
You have absolutely no self-control.

429
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,708
What's your problem?

430
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,708
I called her, but she didn't answer.

431
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:11,792
Call her again.
Try calling Vidya.

432
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:14,625
I called Vidya, but she didn't answer.

433
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,417
Call her again.

434
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,417
For me, our friendship
is like peeing my pants.

435
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,083
It may look gross to everyone else

436
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:24,458
but only I can feel its warmth.

437
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,750
They will be here soon, am I right?

438
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:30,583
Everyone at the girls' hostel
has been strictly instructed.

439
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,250
No one will smear color on Preeti.

440
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,125
You will be the first one to do so.

441
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,167
I wanted it to be a surprise, but...

442
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,125
Stop ruining his surprise.

443
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,750
He's been bothering me all day.

444
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:43,500
- So what?
- So...

445
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:46,042
- What happened to you?
- It's just an injury.

446
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,167
I think someone has beaten him up.

447
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,750
I banged my head against the door.

448
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:55,750
I saw Preeti outside the girls' hostel.

449
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,500
She was dressed in white.

450
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:02,583
No one smeared any color on her.

451
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,875
Don't worry, everything is under control.

452
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:06,042
I'll go get her.

453
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,167
- Why?
- Let him go.

454
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,375
Hey, Kabir!

455
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:11,292
- What's up?
- Hello!

456
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,625
Greetings, Tomar!

457
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,625
- Kamal, how are you?
- I'm fine.

458
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:16,500
What's up?

459
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,208
We're just celebrating Holi.

460
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,083
What brings you here?

461
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,125
I'm appearing for the
General Medicine exam

462
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,250
for the fifth time.

463
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:29,667
I'm going to make the dean sit with me.
Let's see who's better.

464
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:32,893
- Are you done with your internship?
- Yes.

465
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:33,917
What!

466
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,750
Who the hell touched her? That asshole!

467
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,167
I'll be there!

468
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,417
Preeti.

469
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:24,542
There's nothing to cry about.

470
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:30,167
Go take a shower.

471
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,625
Come here.

472
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,333
Tell me everything.

473
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,333
There were six of them, sir.

474
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,167
Go on.

475
00:42:57,292 --> 00:42:59,458
- They came here and...
- Speak up!

476
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:04,708
They are the guys you had a fight with
during the football match.

477
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,625
They were asking around
for Preeti Sikka.

478
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,833
Once they found out who she was,

479
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,042
they smeared color on her
quite brutally.

480
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:13,458
She was crying and screaming.

481
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,083
On which parts of her body?

482
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,542
Sir, on her chest.

483
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,125
And her hips.

484
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,708
We couldn't help her.

485
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:28,542
One of them had a long face,
like that of a parrot.

486
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:34,125
I don't want anyone to know about this.

487
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:35,667
Get lost.

488
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:37,125
Get lost.

489
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:00,667
Amit!

490
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,333
Where the hell are you hiding?
Come out, asshole!

491
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,083
Amit!

492
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:41,542
Stop it!

493
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:45,042
If you touch her again, I will kill you!

494
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:49,917
- Calm down...
- Let me go!

495
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,000
Do you know what he did to her?

496
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,625
Would you like it if I do that
to your family member?

497
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,750
Answer me, asshole!

498
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:02,542
Let me go!

499
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,917
Imagine his audacity
while we are still around!

500
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,333
What if he does this again in our absence?

501
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,000
Who's going to guarantee
that it won't happen again?

502
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:12,958
Calm down.

503
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:14,667
Will you, asshole?

504
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:17,125
- Will you? Asshole...
- Kabir!

505
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,333
Kabir!

506
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,542
- Let me go!
- Give me a cigarette, asshole!

507
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,125
Give me a lighter.

508
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,250
Give me a lighter!

509
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,375
There's only one thing I've learnt.

510
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,917
When anything happens to us...

511
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:03,083
And if anything happens to her...

512
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:22,000
What you did was completely wrong!

513
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:26,458
Promise me that you won't do it again.

514
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:31,792
This is fun.

515
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:35,875
It's fun watching Kabir Rajdheer Singh
scared out of his wits!

516
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:42,292
I promise you I won't do it again.

517
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,417
That's the problem with
the dudes in London.

518
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,750
He's got a low mentality.

519
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:37,458
I'll call you later, I am at the clinic.

520
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:47,292
Are you writing a thesis?

521
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:49,083
My mind works better
in this condition.

522
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,542
Why did you separate the fishes?

523
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:55,542
They make a lot of noise.

524
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,625
They are very active at night.

525
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:02,708
That is why I separated them.

526
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:04,000
Are you out of your mind?

527
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,542
You're losing it!

528
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:19,208
Sir, it slipped out of my hands.

529
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:22,917
I'll bring you a new set, I promise.

530
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,542
Sir, please forgive me.

531
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:29,333
No!

532
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:30,875
I'm sorry!

533
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,875
Hold on, Kabir!

534
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:37,542
Kabir!

535
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:39,250
Wait!

536
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,208
Hold on!

537
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,083
He won't give up!

538
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,708
What is wrong with you?

539
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:41,458
No!

540
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,875
Are you crazy?

541
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,667
You would've killed her.

542
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:52,917
The maids have a bloody union.

543
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,583
Oh, God!

544
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,125
Don't let her in!

545
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:03,417
Stop it, man.

546
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,958
She has already broken ten glasses.

547
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:08,083
All she needs is a tight slap
to learn her lesson.

548
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,708
- Are you performing a suture?
- Yes.

549
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:27,000
It will heal on its own,
she doesn't need a suture.

550
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:29,958
- Why isn't anyone saying anything?
- We just got here.

551
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,833
- That's right.
- Just now.

552
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,833
You've just graduated and you
want to try your hands at suturing?

553
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,583
Does she look like a guinea pig?

554
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,750
Is she even a doctor?

555
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,250
It's a deep cut.

556
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,250
Not really.
First aid should suffice.

557
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,792
It's going to hurt, just bear with it.

558
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,333
Shiva, she needs a tetanus shot.

559
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:59,000
Where were you roaming around?

560
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:01,167
Hostel.

561
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,375
At the hostel.

562
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,167
Shiva, get her a wheelchair.

563
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:10,167
- Why?
- She needs to move out.

564
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,417
- Where to?
- The boys' hostel.

565
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,083
- Yes.
- Are you out of your mind?

566
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:19,917
It's a deep cut.

567
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:21,917
How will she manage on her own?

568
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:25,167
She is just a kid.

569
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
A kid?

570
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:30,542
She needs to study for the exams.
She needs help with her daily chores.

571
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,958
Her father asked me to take care of her.

572
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:41,833
Her father also asked you
to treat her like a sister.

573
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:44,625
Get her a wheelchair.

574
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:46,708
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

575
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:48,875
Why?

576
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:02,125
Who drinks beer?

577
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:04,083
- You?
- No, sir.

578
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,458
How did a beer bottle
end up in the girls' hostel?

579
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,500
Did you use it to wash your hair?

580
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:13,542
Preeti stepped on a broken beer bottle.

581
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,458
Get Preeti's clothes.

582
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:18,417
Okay.

583
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,292
Tell the warden that...

584
00:52:28,292 --> 00:52:29,652
Where are the rest of the clothes?

585
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:31,792
There.

586
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:33,375
Come on.

587
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:55,667
<i>All my paths lead to you.</i>

588
00:53:55,917 --> 00:54:00,542
<i>You are the one for me.</i>

589
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:09,208
<i>You are my love You
are the one for me.</i>

590
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,167
<i>I will never leave you</i>

591
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,000
<i>I'll always follow you.</i>

592
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:21,333
<i>I will take you away with me
Even God can't stop me.</i>

593
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:26,208
<i>You are going to be my destiny</i>

594
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:30,458
<i>I will be yours forever.</i>

595
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:35,667
<i>I will be yours forever.</i>

596
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:42,792
<i>Trust me, sweetheart.</i>

597
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:48,042
<i>I'll always keep the promises I make.</i>

598
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:52,750
<i>You will be mine forever and ever</i>

599
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:57,042
<i>I will be yours forever.</i>

600
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:02,208
<i>I will be yours forever.</i>

601
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:14,583
Kabir, we've vacated that wing

602
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,875
so that you don't feel suffocated.

603
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:18,333
Keep the door open.

604
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:52,917
<i>I feel alienated from myself.</i>

605
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:57,833
<i>You're the journey
I am the traveler.</i>

606
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:03,417
<i>I've forsaken the world</i>

607
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,583
<i>I've renounced everything.</i>

608
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:10,042
Preeti.

609
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:14,208
Is this yours?

610
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:26,750
Excuse me. What's going on?

611
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,042
Girls are being allowed
into the boys' hostel.

612
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:30,833
All of us should get one for ourselves.

613
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:32,375
- We will.
- Yes, we will.

614
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:33,583
Okay.

615
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:36,292
I'll talk to him.

616
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:37,750
About what?

617
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,208
- I don't think so.
- No way.

618
00:56:39,292 --> 00:56:40,292
- Quiet!
- Go on.

619
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:42,083
Go ahead, talk to him.

620
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,208
Kabir.

621
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:11,417
Preeti, watch your stole.

622
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,708
Shiva, what's the problem with Shruti?

623
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,167
What's the matter?

624
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:23,542
She was asking Preeti

625
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:27,000
if we were together last night
at the hostel.

626
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,542
She could have asked her
in a better way.

627
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:42,750
I hate it when someone
interferes in my personal space.

628
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,708
- She is her friend.
- No.

629
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,292
She is a junior, we're the seniors.

630
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:51,500
- Fine, I'll talk to her.
- You better do.

631
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:54,792
You shouldn't have taken her
to the boys' hostel.

632
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,125
Why?

633
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:59,625
Preeti will stay with me, in my room.

634
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:01,667
Nobody can stop me.

635
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:03,708
Nobody.

636
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,625
Kabir.

637
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:12,833
<i>I feel alienated from myself.</i>

638
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:18,292
<i>You're the journey
I am the traveler</i>

639
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:23,375
<i>I've forsaken the world</i>

640
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:28,250
<i>I've renounced everything</i>

641
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:33,417
<i>I shall forsake everything for you</i>

642
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:38,792
<i>I shall forsake everything for you.</i>

643
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:43,583
<i>I shall remain in your heart</i>

644
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:47,750
<i>I will be yours forever.</i>

645
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:52,708
<i>I will be yours forever.</i>

646
00:58:55,042 --> 00:59:00,208
<i>Trust me, sweetheart.</i>

647
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:05,417
<i>I'll always keep the promises I make.</i>

648
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:10,167
<i>You will be mine forever</i>

649
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:14,208
<i>I will be yours forever.</i>

650
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:19,125
<i>I will be yours forever.</i>

651
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:25,583
Preeti, your exams are over.

652
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,500
Are you going back to Mumbai?

653
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:28,917
We leave in two days.

654
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,125
You need to start packing.

655
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:31,292
I know.

656
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:40,083
Stay here for two more days.

657
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:43,917
We've already discussed this.

658
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,667
I cannot leave until you're here.

659
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:52,583
Let's go together.

660
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:55,542
You can catch a flight to Dehradun
while I leave for Mumbai.

661
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,875
The tickets are booked.

662
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,583
Why are you doing this?

663
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:26,000
We're going to leave all this behind.

664
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:29,042
I'll miss the college campus.

665
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,375
Delhi's winter.

666
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:35,750
The house that we lived in
for almost a year.

667
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,458
Mulchand's food.

668
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,042
Our picnics.

669
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:41,583
Our friendship, this song.

670
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:44,625
- I'll miss all of it.
- Shut up.

671
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,184
He's going abroad.
I'm going to Mussoorie to study further.

672
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:50,250
You've got your clinic.
So, what's the problem?

673
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:52,875
Three years later,
we'll be very successful.

674
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,833
Enough with your nostalgia.

675
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,125
May I ask you a question?

676
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:10,083
Please don't be mad at me.

677
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,792
Go on.

678
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:13,833
Stay here for two more days.

679
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:21,667
Kamal.

680
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:27,917
I am not joking.

681
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,958
I never addressed you informally.

682
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:33,292
You never addressed me at all.

683
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:40,792
<i>Look at the lovebirds...</i>

684
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:43,333
Shut up! Let them be happy.

685
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:45,125
Because you're never going to be.

686
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:47,958
<i>Look at the lovebirds...</i>

687
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:52,792
<i>There's love all around</i> Stop
it, idiot.

688
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:56,208
<i>Love shall conquer.</i>

689
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:03,458
Baby, just two more days.

690
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:13,917
Two days...

691
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:17,125
You've been saying that repeatedly.

692
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:19,750
I can't go until you leave.

693
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,167
Am I dying?

694
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,833
You're crying...

695
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:36,583
after you hit me.

696
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:40,042
Preeti.

697
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,708
<i>I can feel the restlessness.</i>

698
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:04,708
<i>Growing in my heart.</i>

699
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:08,792
<i>I don't understand her</i>

700
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:12,125
<i>I don't really understand what she says.</i>

701
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,833
<i>I can feel the restlessness.</i>

702
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:26,667
<i>Growing in my heart.</i>

703
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:31,792
<i>I don't understand her</i>

704
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:35,083
<i>I don't really understand what she says.</i>

705
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:43,167
<i>She leaves her
fragrance In the air.</i>

706
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:47,458
<i>She leaves a part of her.</i>

707
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:55,708
<i>In the air It's my first love.</i>

708
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:04,750
<i>It's my first love.</i>

709
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:10,417
<i>It's my first love</i>
You'll catch a cold.

710
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,458
We've only been away for 15 days.

711
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:58,625
What do you mean by that?

712
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:01,292
So, what we did in Delhi
was unorthodox?

713
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:31,417
<i>It's my first love.</i>

714
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:39,417
<i>It's my first love.</i>

715
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:28,792
<i>All my desires are unreasonable.</i>

716
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:32,500
<i>You're the only genuine one.</i>

717
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:37,625
<i>You are exactly what I wanted you to be.</i>

718
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:43,583
<i>There are many stars in the sky.</i>

719
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:52,500
<i>And yet I only want
to look up to you.</i>

720
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:57,125
<i>It feels as if you are.</i>

721
01:06:57,208 --> 01:07:04,000
<i>Spreading your magic
in the air Without you</i>

722
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:12,083
<i>I am nothing She
leaves her fragrance.</i>

723
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:15,542
<i>In the air.</i>

724
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:22,292
<i>She leaves a part
of her In the air.</i>

725
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:30,333
<i>It's my first love.</i>

726
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:37,625
<i>It's my first love.</i>

727
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,375
Is this your house?

728
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,500
It's beautiful.

729
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:35,625
Kabir, he's my younger brother Gurpal.

730
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:39,042
- Gurpal Sikka.
- Kabir.

731
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:40,625
What's your surname?

732
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:53,875
Mom, that's Kabir.

733
01:08:54,917 --> 01:08:55,917
Greetings.

734
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:57,833
That's my elder sister Neeti.

735
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,292
Where's Uncle?

736
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,208
I wanted to speak to him.

737
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:05,083
He's gone out.
But he'll be back soon.

738
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:08,417
My brother is about to get married.

739
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,167
I'll bring her back soon.

740
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:16,417
We take every decision unanimously.

741
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:18,292
Her father will be back soon.

742
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:20,042
Why don't you wait for him?

743
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,417
Preeti!

744
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:04,875
Uncle, I was just about to talk to you.

745
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:08,125
I understand that our relationship
hasn't been formalized

746
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:10,000
and you must be angry about what you saw.

747
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:14,500
But if we were married,
you would've simply left us alone.

748
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:19,167
Dad!

749
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,375
Uncle, please listen to me...

750
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:23,833
- Rascal!
- Dad.

751
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:25,583
- I will kill you!
- Dad!

752
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:29,458
I knew it! You're a scumbag!

753
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,417
How dare you enter my house? Get out!

754
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:34,583
Bloody spoilt brat!

755
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:36,417
Get out!

756
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:39,292
If I see you again,
I'll break your legs!

757
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,417
Let's go inside.

758
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,250
Should I talk to him, or leave?

759
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:53,792
Preeti, let's go inside.

760
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,208
He is misunderstanding it.

761
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,333
Is that him?

762
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,875
- Is that him?
- Yes.

763
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:20,583
Step out of your car.

764
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:25,708
What's up?

765
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:28,542
What were you doing on the terrace?

766
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:35,792
Gurpal Sikka, come here.

767
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:44,667
Moron!

768
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:46,750
You're my brother-in-law.

769
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:49,333
I love your sister.

770
01:11:49,917 --> 01:11:51,500
So that makes us family.

771
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,042
Talk to your father.

772
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:57,208
You look like your sister.

773
01:11:57,542 --> 01:12:00,125
Your eyes, nose and cheeks
are just like hers.

774
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:05,292
Which grade are you in?

775
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:09,833
Stop wasting your time
and focus on your studies.

776
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:12,292
What did you promise them?

777
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:14,125
A house party.

778
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:25,625
Go, party.

779
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:34,375
Tell your father that I kissed you.

780
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,375
What did you do?

781
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:53,042
Kabir.

782
01:12:53,292 --> 01:12:55,375
What did you do?

783
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,458
I'll explain.

784
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,333
I went to meet her family.
We were together on the terrace.

785
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,958
Her father came out, and...

786
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:08,042
What are you saying?

787
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,833
We were in our private space.

788
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:16,542
He thought we were
doing something wrong.

789
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:19,458
What do you mean by "private space"?

790
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:21,167
Please explain it to him.

791
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:22,850
- Wait...
- Why will he explain it to me?

792
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:24,250
Wait a minute. Kabir, answer me.

793
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:27,583
Don't cross your limits.

794
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:29,583
How does that matter?

795
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,667
Just tell me what you did!

796
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:49,208
Relax, Dad. I'll talk to him.

797
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:55,000
Kabir.

798
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:57,208
Sit up.

799
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:07,542
Just tell your father that
you want to get married.

800
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:11,292
Stop beating around the bush
and tell him what you really want.

801
01:14:11,417 --> 01:14:13,625
Grandma, I tried to explain it to him.

802
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:15,875
I told him that Preeti and I
were in our private space.

803
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:19,250
But he just doesn't understand.

804
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,000
There is no way he will understand.

805
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,625
But when marriage is on the cards,

806
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,292
it concerns a lot of people.

807
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:35,000
They judge you, pass opinions,
even take decisions for you.

808
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,333
That's how you establish a relationship.

809
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:44,708
I am sure caste was not a problem
when you and Grandpa were together.

810
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,958
Everything must have
been relatively easy.

811
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,458
That's not true.

812
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:50,833
My aunt used to taunt me all the time.

813
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:53,625
"We sent her to Delhi
so that she could study further,

814
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:55,667
but look at what she did instead."

815
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,375
What if they had said
that you two can never marry?

816
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:12,875
- I would have convinced them.
- It's not that simple.

817
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:16,500
What if they had said that
they'll never let it happen?

818
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,068
I would have still convinced them.

819
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:19,750
You don't get it.

820
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:24,000
- He's an idiot.
- That's what you think.

821
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:25,833
He's her father, after all.

822
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:28,167
Calm down.

823
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,958
Dad, they love each other a lot.

824
01:15:33,292 --> 01:15:35,333
I think we should go
and talk to her family.

825
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:36,833
You are about to get married.

826
01:15:37,542 --> 01:15:39,708
We don't have the time for this.

827
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:43,000
If Kabir thinks he's doing
the right thing,

828
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:44,250
and so does the girl,

829
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,125
then they can come over instead.

830
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,792
- How does that matter?
- Please try to understand.

831
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,667
Hello, Uncle.

832
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,125
I want to meet Kabir.

833
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,208
He is inside.

834
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:02,625
Did you see that?

835
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:06,625
Grandma, that's Preeti.

836
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:08,458
Hello.

837
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:10,833
Come in.

838
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:18,208
You look good together.

839
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:25,042
You shall live happily ever after.

840
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:26,292
Kabir.

841
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:47,833
Is this your house?

842
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:49,625
It's beautiful.

843
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:55,417
There's no need for this small talk.

844
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,333
Baby, I'll talk to him.

845
01:16:59,042 --> 01:17:01,000
There's no need to talk to him.

846
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:03,958
Kabir!

847
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:16,792
Did you kiss my brother?

848
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:23,292
I'll kiss your father, your mother,
and your sister.

849
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,750
We'll have our first night here, won't we?

850
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:52,792
That's how it is.

851
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:58,208
Then how are you so sure
that 549 is the correct figure?

852
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:01,917
How are you so sure that it's not?

853
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:14,083
Now?

854
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:15,875
There's a wedding at hand.

855
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,375
We'll be fine.

856
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,042
Stop!

857
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:36,042
Don't you dare enter my house!

858
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:37,750
I had warned you yesterday.

859
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,208
Uncle, please hear me out.

860
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,333
I am really sorry for
what happened yesterday.

861
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:46,417
But please don't misjudge
our relationship.

862
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:48,625
Preeti means the world to me.

863
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,792
I will always take care of her.

864
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:52,500
I've completed my master's.

865
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:55,042
I am sure to get a good job.

866
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,875
Everyone will be comfortable
once you meet my family.

867
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:02,000
Are you boasting about your wealth?

868
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:03,750
No way.

869
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:05,417
Keep your money to yourself!

870
01:19:05,792 --> 01:19:08,417
I understand that this
seems childish to you.

871
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:10,625
But once you hear me out,

872
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:13,750
you will understand the genuineness
of our relationship.

873
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,792
Are you listening to him?

874
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,833
- Please hear him out.
- Shut up!

875
01:19:18,542 --> 01:19:21,125
How dare you bring him home?

876
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:22,875
Shameless girl!

877
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,750
Don't you care about our reputation?

878
01:19:25,917 --> 01:19:28,833
Listen to me carefully.

879
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,375
Her marriage has been my lifelong dream.

880
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:33,542
I'll choose the man she gets married to.

881
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:37,000
I'll make sure she never marries you!

882
01:19:37,542 --> 01:19:38,792
What's going on?

883
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,417
- Is he the guy?
- That's him.

884
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:43,042
- That's him.
- Yes.

885
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:44,083
Listen up!

886
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,000
Yes, that's him.

887
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:46,083
Why are you here?

888
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:46,958
Get out!

889
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:48,542
This is a personal matter!

890
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:51,625
Uncle, are you out of your mind?

891
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:53,625
She loves me!

892
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:55,583
She means everything to me!

893
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,458
And this is how you treat me?

894
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,375
I'm not a bloody crook.

895
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:07,458
He's talking in Punjabi!
Get out of here, asshole!

896
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Preeti?

897
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,125
Kabir!

898
01:20:19,917 --> 01:20:20,958
Preeti!

899
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:22,292
Preeti!

900
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:27,000
You should have told your father
about our lovemaking.

901
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:28,375
Stop it.

902
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:30,625
What else am I supposed to say?

903
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:32,125
He will never understand!

904
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:34,250
Because there is nothing
between your mom and dad.

905
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:39,875
Preeti.

906
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,250
We've had enough, come inside.

907
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:45,333
This man is insulting our parents.

908
01:20:50,917 --> 01:20:51,917
Preeti!

909
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,083
Who the hell are you?

910
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:58,583
Dial 1-0-0.

911
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,125
Kabir, it's about love...

912
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:24,042
I'll slap you if you try to be dramatic!

913
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,292
He still doesn't understand.

914
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:33,000
Say that again.

915
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:38,292
I'll cuss as much as I want to.

916
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:44,208
Imagine this is the 18th century.

917
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,917
I would've locked him in a cage

918
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,458
and married you in front of him.

919
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:53,917
You're crazy.

920
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:00,417
What's the saying?

921
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,000
"We're made for each other."

922
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:09,833
Your father, your grandfather,
and all your forefathers were born for me.

923
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:18,083
But look at what's happening!

924
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:25,750
You have six hours.

925
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:28,917
Think and decide!

926
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,542
Got it?

927
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:35,208
I can do anything for you, Preeti.

928
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:37,875
If you are madly in love with me,
then call me.

929
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:43,708
What are you afraid of?

930
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,292
They'll get you married to that clown.

931
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:07,250
Your bones will get dislocated.

932
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:09,042
Preeti.

933
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,917
Look, your father is coming!

934
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:15,417
He's looking at us angrily.

935
01:23:15,667 --> 01:23:16,792
Let him!

936
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,625
What about your reputation?

937
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,042
What about your honor?

938
01:23:30,792 --> 01:23:31,792
Who are you?

939
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:34,583
You have no identity except for...

940
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:37,833
being Kabir Rajdheer Singh's girl,
that's it.

941
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:40,417
That's true.

942
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:41,917
I have no identity of my own.

943
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:48,875
What's wrong?

944
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,583
Nothing.

945
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:53,042
I'm just enjoying your bachelor party.

946
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:56,042
Of course.

947
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:58,958
- Drink all you want.
- I will. Leave me alone.

948
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:05,042
Preeti, what is all this?

949
01:25:06,292 --> 01:25:07,458
Mom.

950
01:25:07,542 --> 01:25:08,542
Look at this.

951
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:10,375
Was she really studying?

952
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:13,250
Her in-box is full of this filth.

953
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:17,708
You will find it interesting.

954
01:25:17,792 --> 01:25:18,792
Stop it, Preeti.

955
01:25:23,542 --> 01:25:24,875
And yes, you read that right.

956
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:27,000
We have done it more than 100 times.

957
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,125
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

958
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:40,625
<i>Your love drives me crazy.</i>

959
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:45,333
<i>Your love drives me crazy...</i>

960
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:55,083
Shankar.

961
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,333
Yes, sir.

962
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,417
Get me a pen and a paper.

963
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:02,625
I have a headache,
get me this medicine.

964
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:04,417
Okay, sir.

965
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:16,500
Kabir.

966
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,417
Kabir, open the door.

967
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:23,667
Kabir, Preeti was here to see you.

968
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,875
That was a close shave.

969
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,333
He mixed morphine with alcohol!

970
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:39,083
What is his problem?

971
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:41,792
- I don't know what to say.
- This is ridiculous!

972
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:43,958
Even a single unit more

973
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:45,875
and he would've slipped into a coma.

974
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,042
Damn it!

975
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:52,500
Any chance of him waking up
in the afternoon?

976
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,042
Are you crazy?

977
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:58,083
Do you want him to attend
his brother's wedding?

978
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,458
His girlfriend is getting married
in the afternoon.

979
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,958
- Does he know about this?
- No, sir.

980
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:08,625
Is she the same girl for whom
he had beaten up a guy?

981
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,042
Yes, sir.

982
01:29:11,542 --> 01:29:14,667
Our college is really jinxed
when it comes to relationships.

983
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:16,417
Not even one worked out.

984
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:18,375
He won't wake up for the next 36 hours.

985
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:20,833
When he does, let him know
that his girlfriend is married.

986
01:29:21,167 --> 01:29:23,208
I can't stay here any longer.

987
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:24,333
Call me later.

988
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:15,458
What an excellent bunch of doctors!

989
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,042
Take his hand off his chest.

990
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,500
I'm still alive.

991
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:38,917
She is getting married in the afternoon.

992
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:44,208
Does he know that?

993
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:46,417
He doesn't know about it.

994
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,250
Here's what I told them yesterday.

995
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:52,958
"You shall live happily ever after."

996
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:57,417
But she's getting married
to someone else.

997
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,333
Sister, is he all right?

998
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:01,875
Why is he lying down?

999
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:05,042
Please go away. He's okay.

1000
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:22,958
You're awake!

1001
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:27,000
Who made me wear this diaper?

1002
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,042
Give me a cigarette.

1003
01:31:58,542 --> 01:31:59,958
Take it off.

1004
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:02,292
- Come on.
- That's not how it comes off.

1005
01:32:02,667 --> 01:32:04,792
You need to soak it in water
for a couple of minutes.

1006
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:06,667
But you have no patience.

1007
01:32:07,042 --> 01:32:10,917
If you had any patience at all,
things would have been better.

1008
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:13,500
Is she still crying over that?

1009
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:15,542
No. She's married.

1010
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:21,292
Let her get married, I don't care.

1011
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,042
My feelings won't change
when she gets married.

1012
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,917
She's already married.

1013
01:32:30,417 --> 01:32:31,417
Yes.

1014
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:34,292
She got married to someone else yesterday.

1015
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:48,292
There's no point in going there.
It's over.

1016
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:49,833
Kabir!

1017
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:53,042
Kabir, where are you going?

1018
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:54,833
Didn't you bless us the other day?

1019
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:58,500
"You shall live happily ever after."

1020
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:00,250
Now sit here and pray!

1021
01:33:12,833 --> 01:33:20,667
<i>Oh, Sweetheart How do
I live without you?</i>

1022
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:22,042
Kabir!

1023
01:33:22,792 --> 01:33:24,458
Kabir, hop on.

1024
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:29,000
What's the point of all this?

1025
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:31,833
<i>Oh, Sweetheart</i> Come on.

1026
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,625
<i>Oh, Sweetheart.</i>

1027
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:43,917
Preeti!

1028
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:45,958
Preeti!

1029
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:50,792
Preeti!

1030
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:52,417
Preeti!

1031
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,083
Move away!

1032
01:33:58,292 --> 01:34:00,208
Preeti!

1033
01:34:00,292 --> 01:34:01,875
Get him!

1034
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,000
Get him!

1035
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,333
Let go of me!

1036
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:09,958
Preeti!

1037
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:12,542
Preeti!

1038
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:18,792
<i>Oh, Sweetheart How do
I live without you?</i>

1039
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,500
- Beat him up!
- Yes!

1040
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:22,333
Kill him!

1041
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:24,583
He's an asshole!

1042
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:28,042
- Please don't hit him!
- Get away!

1043
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:29,542
He is not doing well.

1044
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:32,542
- Uncle, please stop them.
- Get lost, rascal!

1045
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,042
Get lost!

1046
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,667
Let him go! Or else,
I'll break this old man's head!

1047
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:45,042
Let him go.

1048
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:53,292
Kabir.

1049
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:58,750
Shiva, is marriage really that powerful?

1050
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:03,583
There's nothing we can do.

1051
01:35:05,875 --> 01:35:09,042
I was unconscious for two days
and they forced her to get married.

1052
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:12,792
What should we do now?

1053
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:16,500
There was so much of noise out there,
but she didn't even flinch.

1054
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:19,333
She gave up very easily.

1055
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:21,917
I'm sure she didn't hear me.

1056
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:23,375
Really?

1057
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:29,375
She is my girl.

1058
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:31,333
I'll go and get her.

1059
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,500
Preeti!

1060
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:42,250
Harpal Sikka!

1061
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,708
I don't care!

1062
01:35:46,042 --> 01:35:47,667
You can get her married ten times!

1063
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:49,500
I'll still be standing right here!

1064
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:55,417
Preeti!

1065
01:35:58,042 --> 01:35:59,500
Call the mental asylum.

1066
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,333
Call the cops.

1067
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,458
Shiva.

1068
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:07,917
Pass me a cigarette.

1069
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,833
Give it to me.

1070
01:36:28,417 --> 01:36:31,625
Hey! Smoking is prohibited here.

1071
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:42,375
Your brother is here.

1072
01:36:58,042 --> 01:37:00,000
Shiva, take him in through the back door.

1073
01:37:03,542 --> 01:37:04,542
Kabir!

1074
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:06,417
How did you get hurt?

1075
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,500
Did you go to meet that girl again?

1076
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:14,250
She is married now, Kabir.

1077
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,250
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Mom!

1078
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:18,417
- Let's go inside.
- Guess what?

1079
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,583
All the guests at the wedding
were asking about you.

1080
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:26,167
I'm tired of lying!

1081
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:29,042
We haven't even clicked
a family photo yet.

1082
01:37:29,167 --> 01:37:30,458
Come on, Mom!

1083
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:33,167
You're concerned about the family photo!

1084
01:37:33,292 --> 01:37:34,875
Get a digital collage.

1085
01:37:34,958 --> 01:37:36,875
What's the big deal?

1086
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,583
Relax. Calm down!

1087
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:42,333
Kabir, get out of the house.

1088
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:45,083
- Dad, hold on.
- Shut up.

1089
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:48,167
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1090
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:49,792
Get out.

1091
01:37:50,667 --> 01:37:51,917
I'll leave after the reception.

1092
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,333
- You are not needed at the reception!
- Stop it, Dad!

1093
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:56,833
Get out!

1094
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:58,750
Dad!

1095
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:11,375
Listen up.

1096
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:13,750
Ask him to come inside.

1097
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:16,500
He is unwell. Leave him alone.

1098
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,542
Clear the plates,
he doesn't want to eat anything.

1099
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:04,958
- Hello.
- Shiva, I got a job.

1100
01:39:05,042 --> 01:39:06,208
Congrats, man.

1101
01:39:06,667 --> 01:39:08,042
Focus on your job.

1102
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:11,625
- Did you see Preeti?
<i>- No.</i>

1103
01:39:12,083 --> 01:39:13,833
Did you get your bike from there?

1104
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,500
I sent my father to collect it.

1105
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:17,583
Ask your father if he saw her.

1106
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:21,417
I am at the clinic, I'll call you later.

1107
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:56,958
<i>Even when my mind is in an abyss</i>

1108
01:39:57,042 --> 01:40:00,250
<i>I can't stop thinking about you.</i>

1109
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:05,417
<i>It makes me wonder.</i>

1110
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,292
<i>Why do lovers have to separate?</i>

1111
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:11,875
<i>I can't explain my joy.</i>

1112
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:16,750
<i>When you were around me.</i>

1113
01:40:16,917 --> 01:40:20,583
<i>And the void between us.</i>

1114
01:40:20,667 --> 01:40:25,542
<i>Is also inexplicable.</i>

1115
01:40:26,167 --> 01:40:29,083
<i>But now that I am away from you.</i>

1116
01:40:29,167 --> 01:40:31,125
<i>Why should I stay away from you?</i>

1117
01:40:31,208 --> 01:40:34,625
<i>I am your pride.</i>

1118
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:37,417
<i>Let's fill this void right now.</i>

1119
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:39,583
<i>You were my dream come true.</i>

1120
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:42,333
<i>Why should I let go of this dream?</i>

1121
01:41:00,417 --> 01:41:02,417
We were devoted to each other.

1122
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,750
And now they have separated us.

1123
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:05,542
They have committed a sin.

1124
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:08,292
Did you notice something?

1125
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:11,000
Back in college, Preeti was
not interested in anyone else.

1126
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,750
She was different.

1127
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:16,375
She loved me.

1128
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:20,792
What did her father say?

1129
01:41:21,042 --> 01:41:22,958
"My pride! My reputation!"

1130
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,333
That's utter bullshit.

1131
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,833
If Preeti and I were together,
we would have had a family.

1132
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:35,790
But because of the "my pride" factor,
we got divided

1133
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:37,873
and that baby will never
see the face of this earth.

1134
01:41:40,292 --> 01:41:41,750
I am sure he knows about us.

1135
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:46,042
Doesn't he have any self-respect?

1136
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,917
Shiva, do you think they're in love?

1137
01:41:54,833 --> 01:41:58,000
I think it's all about sex
for those assholes.

1138
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
<i>The people of the world lack passion.</i>

1139
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:10,417
<i>Why should I be like them?</i>

1140
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:15,375
<i>They are happy
With their failed love stories.</i>

1141
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:18,250
<i>Why should I be like them?</i>

1142
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:47,083
It's been a month since
Preeti got married.

1143
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:49,458
She has moved on.

1144
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:50,917
Right?

1145
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,042
Practically speaking,
this is the line of progress.

1146
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:55,458
Don't remind me about her marital status.

1147
01:42:55,542 --> 01:42:57,625
I won't stop reminding you about that!

1148
01:43:03,042 --> 01:43:04,125
Shiva, come inside.

1149
01:43:04,375 --> 01:43:05,417
No, you'll hit me.

1150
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,083
I swear, I won't.

1151
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:15,833
Imagine that your girlfriend
is going through PMS.

1152
01:43:15,917 --> 01:43:18,667
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Just imagine.

1153
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:21,042
What will you tell her
at that time?

1154
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:24,125
Will you tell her that it's normal,

1155
01:43:24,208 --> 01:43:26,875
and that she is supposed
to handle it on her own?

1156
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:31,458
Or, will you make her lie down...

1157
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:34,333
Hey, look up.

1158
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,167
Or, will you make her lie down on your lap
and give her a warm pillow?

1159
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:39,833
We studied medicine, didn't we?

1160
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:42,958
Will you flex her thighs and hips?

1161
01:43:47,917 --> 01:43:49,250
Will you say, "You're a woman."

1162
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:53,042
Will you tell her that it's her fate?

1163
01:43:53,458 --> 01:43:55,167
Are you going to talk to her like that?

1164
01:43:55,417 --> 01:43:57,750
Do you get it? I don't think so!

1165
01:43:57,833 --> 01:44:00,417
I understand everything.

1166
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:01,708
Really?

1167
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:05,792
Females need love and care
during that time of the month.

1168
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:07,625
You're looking for the
same warmth and care.

1169
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:08,708
Am I right?

1170
01:44:08,792 --> 01:44:12,083
But unlike them,
your mood swings never go away.

1171
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:14,042
Am I right?

1172
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:17,042
I cannot take this anymore.

1173
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:19,167
Time to go to the clinic, see you.

1174
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:26,292
<i>I think about you all the time.</i>

1175
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:33,167
<i>All day,
all night How can I forget you?</i>

1176
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:37,417
<i>You are always in my thoughts.</i>

1177
01:44:37,667 --> 01:44:41,583
<i>Even when my mind is in an abyss</i>

1178
01:44:41,667 --> 01:44:45,042
<i>I can't stop thinking about you.</i>

1179
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:49,917
<i>It makes me wonder.</i>

1180
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,958
<i>Why do lovers have to separate?</i>

1181
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,750
<i>All those beautiful moments.</i>

1182
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:19,542
<i>Are slipping through my hands like sand.</i>

1183
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:27,625
<i>The pain is spreading
Through my veins.</i>

1184
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:32,000
<i>All those beautiful moments.</i>

1185
01:45:32,083 --> 01:45:36,292
<i>Are slipping through my hands like sand.</i>

1186
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:44,375
<i>The pain is spreading
Through my veins.</i>

1187
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:57,125
<i>Come and test me.</i>

1188
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:01,500
<i>Because I'll never give up.</i>

1189
01:46:02,042 --> 01:46:04,875
<i>The distance.</i>

1190
01:46:05,167 --> 01:46:11,125
<i>The distance will not break my resolution.</i>

1191
01:46:12,042 --> 01:46:20,042
<i>She is not disloyal And Nor am I.</i>

1192
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:28,917
<i>I cannot get over
her I just cannot</i>

1193
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,125
<i>I cannot forget her.</i>

1194
01:46:45,208 --> 01:46:46,708
You're still reeking of alcohol.

1195
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:48,292
Use a mouth freshener.

1196
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:50,000
Am I going to kiss someone?

1197
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:52,917
You always have a comeback, don't you?

1198
01:46:53,417 --> 01:46:57,167
Do you think you would've screwed her
if her boyfriend hadn't come around?

1199
01:46:57,667 --> 01:46:59,375
- Yes.
- No way.

1200
01:47:01,375 --> 01:47:03,292
How do you know about her boyfriend?

1201
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:05,917
He's one of my patients.

1202
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:07,708
She's the girl with the short hair.

1203
01:47:09,167 --> 01:47:10,250
How did it all start?

1204
01:47:11,333 --> 01:47:13,792
Her boyfriend had a fracture.

1205
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,708
She used to ask me every day

1206
01:47:15,792 --> 01:47:17,875
whether she should feed
him chicken or just lentils.

1207
01:47:18,208 --> 01:47:20,000
It's not like he had jaundice.

1208
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:21,833
She was asking me about his diet.

1209
01:47:22,292 --> 01:47:25,208
I took a hint and gave her my number.

1210
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:32,625
But you ended up with
ice down your pants.

1211
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:42,750
Shiva, she keeps asking me to shave.
I'll slap her someday.

1212
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:45,125
Don't take her seriously.

1213
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:47,667
Do you really believe
you can forget Preeti?

1214
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:51,792
Time to move on.

1215
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:54,708
Get yourself a girlfriend.

1216
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:58,667
Stop crying.

1217
01:47:59,542 --> 01:48:00,667
Are you crazy?

1218
01:48:01,958 --> 01:48:03,375
Boys don't cry.

1219
01:48:04,167 --> 01:48:06,833
Don't try to change the inevitable.

1220
01:48:07,667 --> 01:48:09,083
Look at yourself.

1221
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:10,583
Stop crying.

1222
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:13,208
Please, just let it go!

1223
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,375
Kabir.

1224
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:20,708
Girls will fall head over heels
in love with you.

1225
01:48:21,292 --> 01:48:23,292
He's obsessed with Preeti!

1226
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:38,792
The actress Jia Sharma is here.

1227
01:48:38,875 --> 01:48:40,583
She's been referred to you.

1228
01:48:42,208 --> 01:48:43,208
Laxman.

1229
01:48:43,667 --> 01:48:44,750
I don't see anyone around.

1230
01:48:44,833 --> 01:48:46,750
It's a very good hospital.

1231
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,667
Dr. Kabir.

1232
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:06,958
In fact, I watched your last film
<i>Dil Hi Dil Mein</i> thrice.

1233
01:49:10,625 --> 01:49:14,292
If you ever want to shoot in our hospital,
then please call me directly.

1234
01:49:14,417 --> 01:49:15,750
You'll be able to do it easily.

1235
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:21,000
While you are here,
in case you need any help...

1236
01:49:25,542 --> 01:49:28,167
Manjari, take good care of her.

1237
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:32,833
Hey! Have you guys lost your mind?

1238
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:36,625
Can't you tell the difference
between black and white?

1239
01:49:37,708 --> 01:49:39,625
Are your vital organs not
functioning properly?

1240
01:49:41,292 --> 01:49:43,852
Are we going to forget our duties
just because she's a celebrity?

1241
01:49:58,292 --> 01:50:02,125
She twisted her leg while dancing.
I could hear her bone break.

1242
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:05,250
Since then, it has been
difficult for her to walk.

1243
01:50:22,875 --> 01:50:25,958
Manjari. Get me the ROM knee brace.

1244
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:27,500
Wear it around your leg.

1245
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:55,750
Laxman.

1246
01:50:56,292 --> 01:50:57,583
What's the doctor's number?

1247
01:51:01,833 --> 01:51:04,000
I thought you want his number.

1248
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:34,042
Relax, I am not into any of that.

1249
01:51:34,125 --> 01:51:35,125
Open your mouth.

1250
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:37,458
- Your teeth are yellow.
- Stop it.

1251
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:42,500
When will you stop boozing, Kabir?

1252
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:44,667
When will you stop boozing?

1253
01:51:45,958 --> 01:51:47,833
You need to move on!

1254
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
You're smoking weed!

1255
01:51:50,083 --> 01:51:53,208
That's not mine.
It belongs to a friend who lives upstairs.

1256
01:51:54,875 --> 01:51:57,542
Kabir, look at this place!

1257
01:51:59,542 --> 01:52:00,458
Let's go.

1258
01:52:00,542 --> 01:52:01,750
- I am not coming.
- Why?

1259
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:03,792
I don't want to!

1260
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:06,167
Why are you on a self-indulgent ego trip?

1261
01:52:07,708 --> 01:52:09,208
You think I'm on an ego trip?

1262
01:52:10,833 --> 01:52:12,125
Listen to me, Kabir.

1263
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:15,500
I'll make sure Dad speaks to you.
Come on.

1264
01:52:19,708 --> 01:52:21,208
Why do you need space?

1265
01:52:23,042 --> 01:52:24,042
Why?

1266
01:52:24,167 --> 01:52:26,042
You haven't come home for four months.

1267
01:52:31,125 --> 01:52:34,250
Do you remember your favorite bike?

1268
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:38,583
I ordered that for you.

1269
01:52:40,125 --> 01:52:42,208
It's imported, all the way from UK.
Let's go.

1270
01:52:47,083 --> 01:52:49,208
- Why are you angry?
- Go away!

1271
01:52:49,917 --> 01:52:52,417
- Just come back home.
- I won't come with you!

1272
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,500
Get lost.

1273
01:52:55,208 --> 01:52:57,292
Kabir, it wasn't easy for me
to find you.

1274
01:52:57,375 --> 01:52:59,375
Did I ask you to come over?

1275
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,583
I am perfectly all right.
Just leave.

1276
01:53:05,417 --> 01:53:06,542
All right.

1277
01:53:08,292 --> 01:53:10,333
I'll have to force you!

1278
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:12,417
I drink!

1279
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:13,917
I smoke weed!

1280
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,458
This is my house. I do as I please!

1281
01:53:23,458 --> 01:53:27,833
Do you want to hit me? Do you?

1282
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:29,500
Do you want to hit me?

1283
01:53:32,958 --> 01:53:33,958
You bloody...

1284
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:35,500
- You bloody...
- Bloody hell!

1285
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:36,833
Bloody hell!

1286
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,042
How dare you yell and cuss...

1287
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:45,833
Come on!

1288
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:48,083
Kabir!

1289
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:01,125
Where did you go for your honeymoon?

1290
01:54:02,458 --> 01:54:03,542
Nowhere.

1291
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:05,167
Why?

1292
01:54:05,458 --> 01:54:06,750
Because you were missing.

1293
01:54:08,458 --> 01:54:10,042
And I didn't feel like going anywhere.

1294
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:13,833
- So, sister-in-law and you...
- Nonsense.

1295
01:54:17,542 --> 01:54:19,417
When are you going to start a family?

1296
01:54:19,708 --> 01:54:20,792
I haven't thought about it.

1297
01:54:21,125 --> 01:54:22,625
We might consider it after two years.

1298
01:54:23,958 --> 01:54:25,542
Consider it?

1299
01:54:32,167 --> 01:54:33,542
You can't plan such things.

1300
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,083
I'll go feed her.

1301
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:57,583
Would you like to have something?

1302
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:59,250
- I'd like some juice.
- Sure, sir.

1303
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,500
Get it for me.

1304
01:55:04,917 --> 01:55:07,583
Ma'am is busy. She'll join you
in a couple of minutes.

1305
01:55:57,542 --> 01:55:58,958
I had a girlfriend in college.

1306
01:55:59,917 --> 01:56:01,083
We used to live together.

1307
01:56:02,792 --> 01:56:04,000
But she got married.

1308
01:56:10,042 --> 01:56:11,042
Kabir.

1309
01:56:43,208 --> 01:56:44,875
Do you need more time to think?

1310
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:52,250
Kabir!

1311
01:56:59,167 --> 01:57:00,208
Laxman!

1312
01:57:09,042 --> 01:57:10,208
Hi, Shiva. Sit down.

1313
01:57:10,292 --> 01:57:11,292
Look who's here.

1314
01:57:13,208 --> 01:57:14,208
- Aman!
- Kabir.

1315
01:57:14,958 --> 01:57:15,958
How are you?

1316
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:18,333
When did you get here?

1317
01:57:18,417 --> 01:57:19,958
This morning.

1318
01:57:21,417 --> 01:57:22,667
Did you get your license?

1319
01:57:22,875 --> 01:57:23,875
Yes.

1320
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:27,250
What's up?

1321
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:31,208
I am here to speak to Keerti's parents
about our wedding.

1322
01:57:32,542 --> 01:57:35,083
- Were you two really in love?
- Yes.

1323
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:37,125
Listen to me.

1324
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:39,250
The people here
are obsessed with caste.

1325
01:57:39,875 --> 01:57:41,333
Don't get too involved.

1326
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:43,417
Beware, they may not agree with you.

1327
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:45,083
I don't want you to end up like me.

1328
01:57:45,583 --> 01:57:48,667
I wish I end up like you.

1329
01:57:49,125 --> 01:57:50,375
I want a celebrity girlfriend.

1330
01:57:50,917 --> 01:57:52,667
What were you telling her?

1331
01:57:52,792 --> 01:57:55,042
- Were you trying to woo her?
- No way.

1332
01:57:55,875 --> 01:57:56,958
Come on.

1333
01:57:58,292 --> 01:57:59,917
I was telling her about Preeti.

1334
01:58:00,042 --> 01:58:02,042
I asked her if she could
help me, physically.

1335
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,625
What did she say?

1336
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:08,667
She will agree.

1337
01:58:09,208 --> 01:58:10,625
But what about you?

1338
01:58:12,208 --> 01:58:13,500
I'm okay!

1339
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:16,250
I don't think so.
You spend all your time at the clinic

1340
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:18,167
with that stethoscope
plugged in your ears.

1341
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:21,792
"Breathe in, breathe out.
Calpol, paracetamol."

1342
01:58:22,458 --> 01:58:23,625
Aren't you bored of all that?

1343
01:58:24,542 --> 01:58:28,250
He got his license and I got done
with my master's six months ago.

1344
01:58:28,542 --> 01:58:29,902
But you haven't progressed at all.

1345
01:58:29,958 --> 01:58:32,333
Did you show him your clinic?

1346
01:58:32,917 --> 01:58:34,208
Show him your clinic.

1347
01:58:35,083 --> 01:58:36,750
It's a sad excuse for a clinic.

1348
01:58:37,875 --> 01:58:39,667
Do you know the kind of patients he gets?

1349
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:42,625
The kind of people that think about
going to the clinic every morning.

1350
01:58:42,708 --> 01:58:44,167
How many patients do you have?

1351
01:58:44,292 --> 01:58:46,667
One? Two? Three?

1352
01:58:47,583 --> 01:58:52,833
Here's what you keep telling me:
"I'll call you later, I am at the clinic."

1353
01:58:56,333 --> 01:59:00,958
He's only interested in keeping a tab
on the girls I date and the things I do.

1354
01:59:01,583 --> 01:59:05,250
I am telling you, Kamal,
he's a sex addict.

1355
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:09,833
Sex addict?

1356
01:59:10,542 --> 01:59:12,667
Take my advice and start afresh.

1357
01:59:13,167 --> 01:59:15,125
Become a surgeon, dissect a body.

1358
01:59:16,333 --> 01:59:18,333
It feels great to have
blood on the gloves.

1359
01:59:19,583 --> 01:59:22,583
If I wasn't crazy about Preeti,
I would've studied Neurology by now.

1360
01:59:22,917 --> 01:59:25,250
I am going to appear
for the entrance exam.

1361
01:59:27,333 --> 01:59:28,708
Kabir!

1362
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:34,625
What's wrong with him?

1363
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,167
Nothing. He's fine.

1364
01:59:37,167 --> 01:59:38,208
I think she agreed.

1365
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,917
<i>Is it the mirror, or is it just you?</i>

1366
02:00:13,417 --> 02:00:18,292
<i>You make me look better every day.</i>

1367
02:00:19,083 --> 02:00:27,083
<i>Why do I think about
you All the time?</i>

1368
02:00:29,875 --> 02:00:34,625
<i>You're like the ocean.</i>

1369
02:00:35,292 --> 02:00:40,458
<i>And I am like the thrashing waves.</i>

1370
02:00:40,875 --> 02:00:45,792
<i>You're a world of emotions.</i>

1371
02:00:46,042 --> 02:00:51,250
<i>While I am just a little speck.</i>

1372
02:00:51,833 --> 02:00:56,125
<i>Is it the mirror, or is it just you?</i>

1373
02:00:57,208 --> 02:01:03,208
<i>You make me look better every day.</i>

1374
02:01:29,833 --> 02:01:35,000
<i>If you are lost</i>

1375
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:40,208
<i>I am willing to take care of you.</i>

1376
02:01:40,833 --> 02:01:46,125
<i>Slowly, dwell in my eyes.</i>

1377
02:01:46,208 --> 02:01:50,583
<i>And come live in my dreams.</i>

1378
02:01:51,708 --> 02:01:56,208
<i>And come live in my dreams</i> -Shiva.
<i>Yes?</i>

1379
02:01:56,875 --> 02:01:59,042
- She is ironing my clothes.
<i>- Who?</i>

1380
02:01:59,417 --> 02:02:00,583
Jia Sharma.

1381
02:02:00,667 --> 02:02:02,875
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm at her house, I just woke up.

1382
02:02:03,375 --> 02:02:05,625
Oh! That's great.

1383
02:02:06,667 --> 02:02:08,167
Nothing happened.

1384
02:02:08,292 --> 02:02:09,917
I don't believe that.

1385
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,292
Trust me.

1386
02:02:11,583 --> 02:02:14,375
<i>I checked her Wikipedia page.</i>

1387
02:02:14,833 --> 02:02:16,250
She's an IIT graduate.

1388
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:20,000
Her father was the chief justice
at the Delhi high court.

1389
02:02:20,292 --> 02:02:23,417
You won't find anyone better.
Just settle down with her.

1390
02:02:23,667 --> 02:02:27,125
<i>She is ironing your clothes.
That means she loves you a lot.</i>

1391
02:02:27,333 --> 02:02:29,917
I don't like anyone doing
all this for me, Shiva.

1392
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:32,708
I used to like doing things for Preeti.

1393
02:02:32,792 --> 02:02:36,708
But she got married six months ago.

1394
02:02:36,792 --> 02:02:38,542
Stop talking about Preeti.

1395
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:40,667
<i>And you need to stop drinking.</i>

1396
02:02:49,125 --> 02:02:51,625
Where are we?

1397
02:02:52,292 --> 02:02:53,500
What if someone sees us?

1398
02:02:55,417 --> 02:02:56,792
Laxman's standing guard.

1399
02:02:57,667 --> 02:02:58,875
No one's going to see us.

1400
02:03:19,708 --> 02:03:20,708
Kabir.

1401
02:03:25,667 --> 02:03:26,667
Kabir.

1402
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:28,458
Kabir.

1403
02:03:30,333 --> 02:03:31,333
Kabir.

1404
02:03:31,625 --> 02:03:32,625
Kabir.

1405
02:03:33,625 --> 02:03:34,625
Kabir!

1406
02:03:35,417 --> 02:03:37,583
Kabir!

1407
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:41,000
What the hell do you mean by that?

1408
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:52,917
You're an intelligent person.
Why don't you get it?

1409
02:03:53,917 --> 02:03:54,917
Kabir!

1410
02:03:55,667 --> 02:03:56,542
I don't want it!

1411
02:03:56,625 --> 02:03:59,917
Kabir!

1412
02:04:02,292 --> 02:04:03,292
Kabir!

1413
02:04:29,292 --> 02:04:30,917
Sir, this is Manjari from the hospital.

1414
02:04:31,125 --> 02:04:33,085
<i>- What happened?
- It's one of Gokhale sir's case.</i>

1415
02:04:33,125 --> 02:04:34,917
<i>Come down to the hospital, immediately.</i>

1416
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,458
It's my day off, Manjari.
Please hang up.

1417
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:43,833
<i>Sir, please don't hang up.</i>

1418
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,625
<i>There's no one out here.</i>

1419
02:04:45,792 --> 02:04:47,125
It's an RTA case.

1420
02:04:47,458 --> 02:04:51,917
- The patient is in a critical condition.
- I can't perform a surgery today.

1421
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,625
<i>Sir, it's an emergency.</i>

1422
02:05:00,083 --> 02:05:01,875
Put the patient on the ventilator.

1423
02:05:05,083 --> 02:05:06,167
I'll get on it right away.

1424
02:06:20,417 --> 02:06:23,000
Kingston Hospital's reputation is at risk.

1425
02:06:29,125 --> 02:06:31,125
What happened at the
operation theater yesterday?

1426
02:06:33,333 --> 02:06:34,458
Answer me!

1427
02:06:35,542 --> 02:06:36,542
Just wait and watch.

1428
02:06:36,667 --> 02:06:38,667
I'll make sure his license is canceled.

1429
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:41,417
Let your favorite surgeon know.

1430
02:06:54,625 --> 02:06:55,625
Kabir.

1431
02:06:56,625 --> 02:06:57,625
What's wrong?

1432
02:06:58,958 --> 02:07:01,000
I don't think you were dehydrated.

1433
02:07:02,292 --> 02:07:03,292
Listen to me, Shiva.

1434
02:07:03,542 --> 02:07:04,917
There comes a time in life

1435
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,833
when your body starts reacting,
it starts warning you.

1436
02:07:08,458 --> 02:07:10,500
That means it has reached its capacity.

1437
02:07:12,125 --> 02:07:13,792
And that's when you should stop all this.

1438
02:07:15,458 --> 02:07:17,375
Did you see his Bile report
and his LFT report?

1439
02:07:17,458 --> 02:07:19,792
- He never listens, sir.
- He will have to.

1440
02:07:20,458 --> 02:07:22,458
He will have to! Or else, he'll die.

1441
02:07:26,375 --> 02:07:29,208
You haven't quit your bad habits.

1442
02:07:29,292 --> 02:07:31,458
Yes, I drink every day.
I am drunk right now.

1443
02:07:31,875 --> 02:07:32,875
Kabir!

1444
02:07:36,083 --> 02:07:37,458
Don't be silly.

1445
02:07:40,417 --> 02:07:41,417
Mom.

1446
02:07:42,458 --> 02:07:43,792
I am going through a phase.

1447
02:07:48,708 --> 02:07:51,792
We have a patient exchange program
with this hospital.

1448
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,250
I spoke to the hospital's director.

1449
02:07:54,667 --> 02:07:55,958
He is not going to listen to me.

1450
02:07:56,417 --> 02:07:59,250
He told me that Kabir
should be sent to prison.

1451
02:07:59,875 --> 02:08:01,958
The higher authorities are involved.

1452
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:03,500
Think about it.

1453
02:08:04,167 --> 02:08:07,917
He's always messing up
with the authorities.

1454
02:08:08,458 --> 02:08:10,167
What is wrong with you guys?

1455
02:08:10,958 --> 02:08:12,583
You guys are dumb.

1456
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:15,375
Can't you shave before
coming to the hospital?

1457
02:08:17,083 --> 02:08:18,708
Irrespective of what we do,

1458
02:08:18,792 --> 02:08:20,375
our appearance should always be neat.

1459
02:08:22,875 --> 02:08:25,250
That morphine episode at his
brother's wedding was personal.

1460
02:08:25,333 --> 02:08:26,458
But this is professional.

1461
02:08:26,958 --> 02:08:28,417
This involves the entire country.

1462
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,167
Haven't you checked WhatsApp?

1463
02:08:30,875 --> 02:08:34,125
Kabir is facing these problems
because of that girl.

1464
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:41,750
This is not true!

1465
02:08:42,292 --> 02:08:44,583
Dr. Kabir Rajdheer Singh
was a brilliant student.

1466
02:08:46,458 --> 02:08:49,125
He graduated from the
Delhi Institute of Medical Science.

1467
02:08:50,292 --> 02:08:52,875
- He does have some anger issues, but...
- Shiva!

1468
02:08:52,958 --> 02:08:55,542
Did you hear what the dean said?

1469
02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:58,458
- Pass me a cigarette.
- Are you out of your mind?

1470
02:09:00,917 --> 02:09:01,917
Here you go.

1471
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:08,583
The Indian Medical Council
is only for doctors!

1472
02:09:13,417 --> 02:09:14,750
What do you suggest we do, Dad?

1473
02:09:19,375 --> 02:09:24,292
Grandma, you keep asking
about Kabir every day.

1474
02:09:25,375 --> 02:09:26,917
Why don't you want to meet him now?

1475
02:09:27,417 --> 02:09:28,458
Well...

1476
02:09:29,292 --> 02:09:31,500
I can't see him in this condition.

1477
02:09:32,375 --> 02:09:34,750
The least you can do
is call him up.

1478
02:09:36,083 --> 02:09:37,375
Grandma, you're the only one...

1479
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:39,375
who can convince Kabir.

1480
02:09:39,875 --> 02:09:43,458
There's a time when our loved ones die.

1481
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:48,708
And then there's a time
when they leave us forever.

1482
02:09:49,333 --> 02:09:53,333
In the first case,
we convince ourselves

1483
02:09:53,917 --> 02:09:56,458
to somehow deal with their absence.

1484
02:09:57,083 --> 02:09:58,292
That's what I've always done.

1485
02:09:58,917 --> 02:10:01,292
But in the second case,
forgetting the one who got away

1486
02:10:01,542 --> 02:10:03,208
is not easy.

1487
02:10:04,167 --> 02:10:05,958
That's exactly what he is going through.

1488
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:08,667
We can do a lot of things for him.

1489
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:12,792
But we cannot share his pain.

1490
02:10:14,042 --> 02:10:16,583
What do you expect me to do?

1491
02:10:55,125 --> 02:10:56,542
He will handle your case.

1492
02:10:58,375 --> 02:10:59,458
There is no case.

1493
02:10:59,958 --> 02:11:01,375
He wasn't my patient.

1494
02:11:02,917 --> 02:11:04,958
Since no one was around,
I performed the surgery.

1495
02:11:10,917 --> 02:11:14,157
What matters is whether the surgeon was
drunk above the permissible level, or not.

1496
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:20,708
Dr. Kabir, how drunk were you?

1497
02:11:21,625 --> 02:11:23,458
Karan, I was sick that day.

1498
02:11:26,542 --> 02:11:28,125
I couldn't even stand up on my own.

1499
02:11:28,625 --> 02:11:31,145
I was sitting on a chair, giving
instructions to the head nurse.

1500
02:11:33,875 --> 02:11:36,375
We know that.

1501
02:11:39,208 --> 02:11:40,208
Kabir!

1502
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:42,990
- Does he know what he's talking about?
- Of course, man.

1503
02:11:49,375 --> 02:11:50,935
The Indian medical counsel is involved.

1504
02:11:52,625 --> 02:11:54,265
The hospital authorities are against you.

1505
02:12:00,625 --> 02:12:02,705
That's what the media is calling you,
for God's sake.

1506
02:12:08,417 --> 02:12:10,125
I want you to have some presence of mind.

1507
02:12:11,958 --> 02:12:15,167
Your patients have signed these papers
and we have a few eyewitnesses as well.

1508
02:12:20,208 --> 02:12:23,417
There are 300 surgeries
registered under your name.

1509
02:12:23,542 --> 02:12:25,333
You have worked for 214 days.

1510
02:12:28,625 --> 02:12:30,250
One couple was out of town, so...

1511
02:12:31,125 --> 02:12:33,083
We can ignore the logbook entries.

1512
02:12:33,708 --> 02:12:36,042
But the radiographs cannot be ignored.

1513
02:12:36,167 --> 02:12:37,667
The radiographs have been embossed.

1514
02:12:40,417 --> 02:12:41,458
And...

1515
02:12:46,125 --> 02:12:47,458
The patient is still alive.

1516
02:12:48,042 --> 02:12:49,583
We can give him some money.

1517
02:12:49,875 --> 02:12:52,250
But the hospital management
took your blood samples.

1518
02:13:00,375 --> 02:13:02,917
They use a preservative
to test the blood samples.

1519
02:13:03,542 --> 02:13:05,708
We'll claim that its fermentation level
wasn't right

1520
02:13:05,792 --> 02:13:07,583
and all the readings were inaccurate.

1521
02:13:09,458 --> 02:13:13,625
But there are 184 surgeries which
haven't been entered in the logbook.

1522
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:21,083
So, within a week let's arrange
for an in-house hearing.

1523
02:13:24,917 --> 02:13:26,625
Kabir, listen to me.

1524
02:13:29,208 --> 02:13:30,625
Go for a shave.

1525
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:33,167
Wear decent clothes.

1526
02:13:34,125 --> 02:13:35,458
Relax.

1527
02:13:37,167 --> 02:13:39,792
Rehearse your statements.

1528
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:56,500
Karan.

1529
02:13:59,708 --> 02:14:02,208
But I fear your brother's
unconventional mindset.

1530
02:14:02,625 --> 02:14:03,875
What about that?

1531
02:14:05,167 --> 02:14:07,583
Democracy does not accept
free-spirited people.

1532
02:14:11,042 --> 02:14:12,083
We've paid people off.

1533
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:14,125
But it shouldn't be too obvious.

1534
02:14:44,333 --> 02:14:45,458
Kabir!

1535
02:14:47,875 --> 02:14:49,125
- Shiva!
- Yes?

1536
02:14:51,333 --> 02:14:52,708
Kabir?

1537
02:14:53,042 --> 02:14:54,042
Wake up, Kabir.

1538
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:55,500
Kabir!

1539
02:14:55,667 --> 02:14:56,750
Kabir...

1540
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:03,583
Be careful.

1541
02:15:13,542 --> 02:15:15,583
Wait right here.
I'll get some stuff from Ankit.

1542
02:15:15,708 --> 02:15:16,958
Kabir.

1543
02:15:17,333 --> 02:15:19,000
Wake up, Kabir.
It's time to go to court.

1544
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:34,542
What is this?

1545
02:15:36,458 --> 02:15:37,375
What are you doing?

1546
02:15:37,458 --> 02:15:38,458
Calm down.

1547
02:15:38,542 --> 02:15:40,167
- Is this necessary?
- Shut up!

1548
02:15:45,917 --> 02:15:47,208
Get up.

1549
02:15:48,917 --> 02:15:49,917
Get up.

1550
02:15:50,208 --> 02:15:51,542
Snort it.

1551
02:15:53,583 --> 02:15:55,667
We don't have time to waste.
Snort it again.

1552
02:16:24,583 --> 02:16:26,875
Bro, is he okay?

1553
02:16:29,583 --> 02:16:30,667
He'll be okay.

1554
02:16:32,875 --> 02:16:36,708
Kabir, your brother has arranged
for an in-house court hearing.

1555
02:16:37,208 --> 02:16:40,042
Please try to stay normal, for God's sake.

1556
02:16:41,042 --> 02:16:43,958
Are you going to teach me
how to behave normally?

1557
02:16:44,042 --> 02:16:45,792
Let's go.

1558
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,500
Get some pants on.
We're running out of time.

1559
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:55,792
Ma'am, this man has a drinking problem.

1560
02:16:56,292 --> 02:16:57,833
I didn't know about it earlier.

1561
02:16:58,333 --> 02:17:02,208
My hospital staff is scared of him.
He compels them to serve him liquor.

1562
02:17:02,708 --> 02:17:03,708
That's not all.

1563
02:17:03,917 --> 02:17:06,042
We found drugs in his dressing room.

1564
02:17:11,625 --> 02:17:14,292
Emotional statements are
not permissible in court.

1565
02:17:14,583 --> 02:17:19,708
I have about 300 recorded videos and
testimonials sent to me by his patients.

1566
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,375
Shiva, do you remember
our convocation day?

1567
02:17:32,375 --> 02:17:33,708
It's going well.

1568
02:17:33,792 --> 02:17:35,917
Please don't ruin it.

1569
02:17:36,083 --> 02:17:37,292
But this is wrong.

1570
02:17:42,417 --> 02:17:43,417
Karan.

1571
02:17:44,333 --> 02:17:45,458
What's going on?

1572
02:17:46,708 --> 02:17:47,792
What's happening?

1573
02:17:48,583 --> 02:17:51,083
How much have you paid them?

1574
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:54,042
Look at Dad, Karan.

1575
02:17:56,458 --> 02:17:59,292
Kabir, just shut up.

1576
02:17:59,375 --> 02:18:02,542
I am proud of one thing in my life.

1577
02:18:06,375 --> 02:18:10,500
My career is the only thing
that I am proud of.

1578
02:18:13,875 --> 02:18:14,917
Oh, God!

1579
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,417
Kabir, we'll talk about this later.

1580
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:19,167
I cannot lie.

1581
02:18:25,583 --> 02:18:28,750
Are you doing this to save yourself
from the embarrassment?

1582
02:18:30,042 --> 02:18:31,167
Look...

1583
02:18:33,125 --> 02:18:34,875
I am going home.

1584
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,458
- I don't want to be here.
- Kabir!

1585
02:18:36,542 --> 02:18:37,542
I'll beat you up!

1586
02:18:37,792 --> 02:18:38,958
Kabir! Sit down.

1587
02:18:40,083 --> 02:18:41,375
I will beat you up!

1588
02:18:43,208 --> 02:18:48,375
Whatever you say now will be admissible
in court towards criminal proceedings.

1589
02:18:56,583 --> 02:18:58,667
What time did you attend the surgery?

1590
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:06,875
Can you explain that to me in detail?

1591
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:13,583
The patient had diabetes.

1592
02:19:21,667 --> 02:19:23,292
During the surgery...

1593
02:19:26,792 --> 02:19:29,083
But even in a state of
partial consciousness,

1594
02:19:29,375 --> 02:19:34,458
you kept giving instructions to the nurse
and stabilized your patient.

1595
02:19:37,167 --> 02:19:40,667
Now tell me, were you intoxicated
the day before the surgery?

1596
02:19:41,042 --> 02:19:45,417
Did you consume alcohol
or some other chemical intoxicants?

1597
02:20:07,083 --> 02:20:08,333
And, the day before that.

1598
02:20:26,125 --> 02:20:30,167
But I never caused discomfort to any
of my patients and I am proud of that.

1599
02:20:43,958 --> 02:20:46,833
The hospital management and the staff
have nothing to do with it.

1600
02:20:52,208 --> 02:20:55,708
Your medical license will
be seized for five years.

1601
02:20:57,417 --> 02:21:01,292
You're not allowed to conduct
any clinical practice.

1602
02:21:01,667 --> 02:21:03,292
If you do so...

1603
02:21:07,917 --> 02:21:11,750
Committing a crime intentionally
is a bigger crime.

1604
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,667
I am going to ask you this only once.

1605
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:35,458
I just need a yes or a no.

1606
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Go ahead.

1607
02:22:38,708 --> 02:22:40,625
Will you marry my sister Divya?

1608
02:22:47,375 --> 02:22:49,542
Do you really love me so much?

1609
02:22:50,667 --> 02:22:51,667
Come here.

1610
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,542
I don't have time for this.

1611
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:54,750
Just answer me.

1612
02:22:55,250 --> 02:22:56,667
Kabir, I want you to settle down.

1613
02:22:59,333 --> 02:23:04,292
That guy from London wasn't
right for Divya, neither am I.

1614
02:23:08,625 --> 02:23:10,000
What on earth are you doing?

1615
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,917
You should have quit college that day.

1616
02:23:14,500 --> 02:23:15,667
Kabir...

1617
02:23:16,292 --> 02:23:17,833
Divya knows everything about you.

1618
02:23:22,292 --> 02:23:23,833
Everything will be fine.

1619
02:23:36,583 --> 02:23:38,292
Where's my fridge? Where's the AC?

1620
02:23:38,625 --> 02:23:40,917
What did you do with all my stuff?

1621
02:23:41,208 --> 02:23:42,500
Wake up.

1622
02:23:42,833 --> 02:23:45,083
I read about you in the newspaper.

1623
02:23:45,458 --> 02:23:48,875
I'll call the cops
if you stay here any longer.

1624
02:23:49,208 --> 02:23:51,833
I let you stay here because
I thought you were a good doctor.

1625
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:53,417
Look at what you've done!

1626
02:23:53,625 --> 02:23:56,292
You should be ashamed of yourself.
What kind of a doctor...

1627
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:01,708
It belongs to a friend.

1628
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,083
You can stay here tonight.

1629
02:24:04,250 --> 02:24:06,042
I'll find a better place for you tomorrow.

1630
02:24:06,750 --> 02:24:07,917
You can stay here tonight.

1631
02:24:08,208 --> 02:24:09,750
I'll be right back.

1632
02:24:28,292 --> 02:24:29,750
Hey, mister! Pay up.

1633
02:24:30,083 --> 02:24:32,250
Hey! Put it on my tab.

1634
02:24:32,958 --> 02:24:35,167
You guys are ridiculous.

1635
02:24:37,750 --> 02:24:45,750
<i>Don't break my heart, sweetheart.</i>

1636
02:24:46,708 --> 02:24:49,375
<i>My heart has been bound to you.</i>

1637
02:24:49,708 --> 02:24:57,042
<i>My heart...
My heart has been bound to you.</i>

1638
02:24:57,375 --> 02:25:02,208
<i>Don't break the promises you made.</i>

1639
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:07,292
<i>Don't break the promises you made.</i>

1640
02:25:07,542 --> 02:25:12,583
<i>My heart has been bound to you</i>

1641
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:20,042
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1642
02:25:20,208 --> 02:25:21,417
And here you are!

1643
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:24,500
Shut up! Get lost!

1644
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:26,875
Come on.

1645
02:25:29,625 --> 02:25:30,667
Kabir.

1646
02:25:31,875 --> 02:25:33,083
Grandma passed away.

1647
02:25:37,417 --> 02:25:39,167
Come on, everyone's waiting for you.

1648
02:25:39,875 --> 02:25:41,000
Come on.

1649
02:25:47,583 --> 02:25:48,667
What are you waiting for?

1650
02:25:56,917 --> 02:25:59,917
Kabir, everyone is waiting for you.

1651
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:03,125
She died in her sleep.

1652
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:06,708
Go inside.

1653
02:26:51,208 --> 02:26:53,250
Why are you sitting here,
all by yourself?

1654
02:26:58,500 --> 02:27:01,000
I can understand how you are feeling.

1655
02:27:05,625 --> 02:27:08,500
You've been affected the most.

1656
02:27:10,875 --> 02:27:12,250
I am here for you.

1657
02:27:13,333 --> 02:27:15,583
We never imagined this day would come.

1658
02:27:16,417 --> 02:27:17,792
It is funny, isn't it?

1659
02:27:20,167 --> 02:27:24,333
To be born, to fall in love, and to die.

1660
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:28,208
These are the three most
crucial occurrences of life.

1661
02:27:29,917 --> 02:27:32,000
The rest are just reactions to that.

1662
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:40,083
People are here to see you.

1663
02:27:41,292 --> 02:27:43,708
This is the most important
moment of your life.

1664
02:27:44,875 --> 02:27:46,000
Everyone's waiting.

1665
02:27:46,708 --> 02:27:48,000
Let's go, Dad.

1666
02:27:49,250 --> 02:27:51,458
Come on, let's go.

1667
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:54,500
Come on.

1668
02:28:06,292 --> 02:28:08,125
Everything will be okay, Dad.

1669
02:28:40,667 --> 02:28:45,625
<i>A mother sits beside her daughter.</i>

1670
02:28:45,792 --> 02:28:49,000
<i>They are discussing life.</i>

1671
02:28:49,125 --> 02:28:54,042
<i>The daughter wonders why her mother
Gave birth to her.</i>

1672
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:07,500
<i>Both of them are more like friends.</i>

1673
02:29:07,750 --> 02:29:12,417
<i>Their bond cannot be broken easily.</i>

1674
02:29:12,750 --> 02:29:14,070
- Be careful with the body.
- Hey!

1675
02:29:15,667 --> 02:29:16,667
Who called her a body?

1676
02:29:17,167 --> 02:29:18,167
Kabir.

1677
02:29:24,458 --> 02:29:28,625
<i>Mother, I come to you.</i>

1678
02:29:44,792 --> 02:29:47,000
Your grandma made sure
your bike was always clean.

1679
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,667
I used to smoke when I was in college.

1680
02:29:55,083 --> 02:29:56,083
Son.

1681
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,542
There's an old English saying.

1682
02:30:06,542 --> 02:30:08,208
It's time for you to move on.

1683
02:30:11,542 --> 02:30:14,333
I promise I'll quit my bad habits.

1684
02:30:15,083 --> 02:30:16,250
It's all right, son.

1685
02:30:24,542 --> 02:30:27,542
You can start all over again.

1686
02:30:29,583 --> 02:30:31,208
What are you thinking?

1687
02:30:32,250 --> 02:30:34,083
Things will change for the better.

1688
02:30:39,875 --> 02:30:41,917
When you come back
we'll discuss your wedding.

1689
02:31:33,875 --> 02:31:39,333
<i>My heart was overwhelmed.</i>

1690
02:31:40,417 --> 02:31:46,000
<i>My love turned to devotion.</i>

1691
02:31:47,042 --> 02:31:53,125
<i>Surrender yourself to me.</i>

1692
02:31:53,583 --> 02:31:59,500
<i>You've become a necessity for me.</i>

1693
02:32:00,125 --> 02:32:05,958
<i>This is coming.</i>

1694
02:32:06,750 --> 02:32:09,667
<i>Straight from my heart.</i>

1695
02:32:10,083 --> 02:32:13,458
<i>Believe me.</i>

1696
02:32:14,083 --> 02:32:19,750
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

1697
02:32:20,542 --> 02:32:26,333
<i>That's how much I love you.</i>

1698
02:32:27,083 --> 02:32:32,583
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

1699
02:32:33,625 --> 02:32:38,333
<i>That's how much I love you.</i>

1700
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:46,167
<i>I shall perish away with you.</i>

1701
02:32:46,833 --> 02:32:52,292
<i>That's how much I love you.</i>

1702
02:33:18,708 --> 02:33:26,708
<i>This is coming
Straight from my heart.</i>

1703
02:33:28,292 --> 02:33:32,042
<i>Believe me.</i>

1704
02:33:32,458 --> 02:33:38,167
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

1705
02:33:38,875 --> 02:33:44,500
<i>That's how much I love you.</i>

1706
02:33:45,583 --> 02:33:51,083
<i>I shall perish away with you.</i>

1707
02:33:52,083 --> 02:33:57,417
<i>That's how much I love you</i>

1708
02:34:23,792 --> 02:34:26,375
I've been trying to call you for two days.

1709
02:34:26,792 --> 02:34:29,208
Either your number's unreachable,
or you don't answer.

1710
02:34:29,667 --> 02:34:30,667
What are you doing?

1711
02:34:31,125 --> 02:34:32,125
Why are you here?

1712
02:34:32,875 --> 02:34:34,667
Aren't you getting married in two days?

1713
02:34:38,542 --> 02:34:39,542
Come on.

1714
02:34:43,458 --> 02:34:44,458
Let's go.

1715
02:34:49,625 --> 02:34:51,667
I saw Preeti at the park.

1716
02:34:53,583 --> 02:34:55,250
She is no longer the same.

1717
02:35:03,083 --> 02:35:04,375
So what?

1718
02:35:05,083 --> 02:35:07,042
I'll ask her if she
wants to come along.

1719
02:35:08,958 --> 02:35:10,167
Do you think she'll agree?

1720
02:35:11,042 --> 02:35:12,042
She will.

1721
02:35:12,833 --> 02:35:14,125
She is my girl.

1722
02:35:15,542 --> 02:35:17,375
She's married, she's having a baby.

1723
02:35:24,792 --> 02:35:27,250
- How do you know she is not happy?
- Come on!

1724
02:35:27,958 --> 02:35:29,726
When Keerti is not happy,
don't you just know it?

1725
02:35:29,750 --> 02:35:32,333
I admit that she got married
against her will.

1726
02:35:32,417 --> 02:35:33,667
But how did she get pregnant?

1727
02:35:34,583 --> 02:35:35,625
Yes, she's pregnant.

1728
02:35:36,125 --> 02:35:37,125
So what?

1729
02:35:38,583 --> 02:35:39,958
Are you crazy, Kabir?

1730
02:35:40,667 --> 02:35:44,250
You'll be up against her
husband, not her father.

1731
02:35:44,458 --> 02:35:45,292
Who is he?

1732
02:35:45,375 --> 02:35:47,083
- "Who is he?"
- Who are you?

1733
02:35:47,542 --> 02:35:49,125
Are you even listening to yourself?

1734
02:35:50,250 --> 02:35:51,458
I am going to Mumbai.

1735
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:59,917
- Kabir.
- This time I won't leave her.

1736
02:36:01,292 --> 02:36:02,667
It's not easy.

1737
02:36:06,458 --> 02:36:08,167
Don't do it, Kabir.

1738
02:36:09,875 --> 02:36:11,042
Let it go.

1739
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:12,750
You're getting married in two days.

1740
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,167
I'll be there with Preeti.

1741
02:36:47,208 --> 02:36:50,292
She's been married for nine months now.

1742
02:36:50,667 --> 02:36:54,042
Everything is different now.
She's pregnant.

1743
02:36:54,208 --> 02:36:55,875
Be patient.

1744
02:36:57,167 --> 02:36:59,125
Or else, the ladies will beat you up.

1745
02:37:09,042 --> 02:37:10,042
Preeti.

1746
02:37:22,292 --> 02:37:23,292
Preeti.

1747
02:37:43,042 --> 02:37:44,125
Preeti.

1748
02:37:57,292 --> 02:37:58,750
Please listen to me.

1749
02:38:06,542 --> 02:38:08,500
Please look at me.

1750
02:38:10,250 --> 02:38:11,958
Pass me some water.

1751
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,708
Preeti, I want to talk to you.

1752
02:38:31,542 --> 02:38:33,750
At least hear me out.

1753
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:36,500
Hear what?

1754
02:38:37,083 --> 02:38:38,292
What do you want to say?

1755
02:38:39,875 --> 02:38:42,250
Did you listen to me that day?

1756
02:38:43,333 --> 02:38:44,750
Why are you here, Kabir?

1757
02:38:45,792 --> 02:38:47,542
You should leave.

1758
02:38:47,958 --> 02:38:48,958
I won't leave.

1759
02:38:50,083 --> 02:38:51,833
You should be ashamed of yourself, Kabir.

1760
02:38:55,958 --> 02:38:57,292
Stay away from me.

1761
02:39:06,583 --> 02:39:07,583
Really?

1762
02:39:08,208 --> 02:39:10,167
How do you know that I am not happy?

1763
02:39:11,250 --> 02:39:12,375
Who are you?

1764
02:39:14,458 --> 02:39:15,458
I am no one.

1765
02:39:21,625 --> 02:39:23,417
That's what you said to me.

1766
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:26,083
That's what happened, Kabir.

1767
02:39:28,875 --> 02:39:30,167
Please leave.

1768
02:39:35,833 --> 02:39:37,792
You gave me six hours that day.

1769
02:39:39,042 --> 02:39:40,500
And then you just left me.

1770
02:39:43,208 --> 02:39:45,917
Girls have certain restrictions at home.

1771
02:39:46,208 --> 02:39:48,417
You won't understand,
because you don't have a sister.

1772
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,542
I came to your house that night.

1773
02:39:52,958 --> 02:39:54,500
I waited outside.

1774
02:39:55,167 --> 02:39:56,208
And when did you arrive?

1775
02:39:56,792 --> 02:39:58,667
Two days later,
when everything was over.

1776
02:39:59,167 --> 02:40:01,417
Where were you for two days?
Were you asleep?

1777
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:04,417
Preeti, he had no idea that you
were waiting for him that night.

1778
02:40:04,833 --> 02:40:06,250
I told him about it recently.

1779
02:40:06,792 --> 02:40:08,000
You didn't call back that day

1780
02:40:08,083 --> 02:40:10,125
and he injected himself with morphine.

1781
02:40:10,333 --> 02:40:11,333
It was an overdose.

1782
02:40:13,167 --> 02:40:14,417
He woke up after two days.

1783
02:40:15,292 --> 02:40:18,708
He slept right through your wedding
and his brother's wedding.

1784
02:40:20,042 --> 02:40:22,242
When he woke up, I told him
that you're getting married.

1785
02:40:24,500 --> 02:40:26,750
After that, his father
threw him out of the house.

1786
02:40:26,833 --> 02:40:29,208
He used to live alone and keep
himself engrossed with work.

1787
02:40:29,542 --> 02:40:33,083
He recently moved back with his family,
after his grandmother's death.

1788
02:40:33,458 --> 02:40:36,875
I am telling you this
because he won't tell you anything.

1789
02:40:37,417 --> 02:40:39,667
Continue talking to each other,
I won't disturb you.

1790
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:47,833
- I came so far only to meet you...
- How far?

1791
02:40:48,208 --> 02:40:49,625
Did you have to scale a mountain?

1792
02:40:49,917 --> 02:40:51,083
Bandra to Chembur.

1793
02:40:51,625 --> 02:40:52,833
I didn't want to look at you.

1794
02:40:52,917 --> 02:40:54,458
Why did you show up the other day?

1795
02:41:01,708 --> 02:41:02,708
Relax, I am leaving.

1796
02:41:03,875 --> 02:41:05,250
I'll never see you again.

1797
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Go on.

1798
02:41:14,125 --> 02:41:16,167
What's stopping you
from coming with me right now?

1799
02:41:22,625 --> 02:41:23,667
Really?

1800
02:41:36,417 --> 02:41:38,000
Fine, I'll come with you.

1801
02:41:38,583 --> 02:41:41,083
But who'll be the father of this child?

1802
02:41:42,458 --> 02:41:43,625
I'll be the father.

1803
02:41:50,458 --> 02:41:52,292
Why do you want to do this, Kabir?

1804
02:41:54,125 --> 02:41:58,167
You have a girlfriend,
you do drugs, you consume alcohol.

1805
02:42:00,333 --> 02:42:01,625
Go away.

1806
02:42:01,708 --> 02:42:04,458
- Preeti, there was nothing between them.
- Hold on.

1807
02:42:05,875 --> 02:42:07,708
Preeti, do you want me to go talk to him?

1808
02:42:08,458 --> 02:42:10,292
Just say yes and I'll
convince him right now.

1809
02:42:18,167 --> 02:42:19,250
Just say it, Preeti.

1810
02:42:23,292 --> 02:42:24,292
Just say it.

1811
02:42:32,458 --> 02:42:33,458
Come here.

1812
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
- Why?
- Come here.

1813
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,583
I left him three days after my wedding.

1814
02:43:18,750 --> 02:43:20,833
I didn't want to come back to you.

1815
02:43:23,042 --> 02:43:25,000
I didn't go back to my parents either.

1816
02:43:26,375 --> 02:43:28,375
I got a place in a hostel to stay in.

1817
02:43:29,083 --> 02:43:30,583
I kept working at the clinic.

1818
02:43:31,458 --> 02:43:33,250
A few days later when I calmed down.

1819
02:43:33,833 --> 02:43:35,542
I thought I'll come back to you.

1820
02:43:35,958 --> 02:43:38,083
But then I realized that
I had skipped my periods.

1821
02:43:38,625 --> 02:43:40,167
I found out that I am pregnant.

1822
02:43:41,458 --> 02:43:43,583
After that I didn't want to meet you.

1823
02:43:44,250 --> 02:43:46,090
A few days later,
I wanted to come back to you.

1824
02:43:46,167 --> 02:43:49,042
But I read about your
affair with that actress.

1825
02:43:52,125 --> 02:43:54,333
I thought you'll come looking for me.

1826
02:44:05,333 --> 02:44:06,333
Kabir.

1827
02:44:20,292 --> 02:44:22,583
<i>Oh, Sweetheart.</i>

1828
02:44:23,125 --> 02:44:28,042
<i>How do I live without you?</i>

1829
02:44:36,125 --> 02:44:38,042
No one knows about this.

1830
02:44:58,625 --> 02:45:02,542
People noticed that no
one ever came to meet me.

1831
02:45:04,833 --> 02:45:07,083
But this old lady looked after me.

1832
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,167
Not a single day went by
when she didn't cry.

1833
02:45:29,292 --> 02:45:30,542
Please look after her.

1834
02:45:33,417 --> 02:45:34,833
Thank you.

1835
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,042
This belongs to her.

1836
02:45:50,875 --> 02:45:54,000
I thought I will never forgive you.

1837
02:45:54,250 --> 02:45:56,042
Not in this lifetime at least.

1838
02:45:56,667 --> 02:45:58,208
But now that you're in front of me

1839
02:45:58,375 --> 02:46:00,667
all the anger seems to have melted away.

1840
02:46:05,292 --> 02:46:07,000
Right now!

1841
02:46:07,125 --> 02:46:11,667
<i>The girls are here, all dressed up
They look great.</i>

1842
02:46:11,875 --> 02:46:16,292
<i>They are wearing golden earrings
And their arms are filled with bangles.</i>

1843
02:46:16,542 --> 02:46:20,875
<i>The girls are here, all dressed up
They look great.</i>

1844
02:46:21,250 --> 02:46:25,417
<i>They are wearing golden earrings
And their arms are filled with bangles.</i>

1845
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:33,500
<i>Oh my dear I am madly
in love with you.</i>

1846
02:47:00,542 --> 02:47:05,125
<i>Don't ever leave me
Let's be together forever.</i>

1847
02:47:05,375 --> 02:47:09,958
<i>You're the one who completes me.</i>

1848
02:47:10,042 --> 02:47:12,125
<i>Don't ever leave me.</i>

1849
02:47:12,208 --> 02:47:14,708
<i>Let's be together forever.</i>

1850
02:47:14,792 --> 02:47:20,042
<i>You're the one who completes me.</i>

1851
02:47:20,542 --> 02:47:25,167
<i>You mean the world
to me You are mine</i>

1852
02:47:25,250 --> 02:47:28,708
<i>I am yours.</i>

1853
02:47:29,125 --> 02:47:32,542
<i>Oh my dear</i>

1854
02:47:32,833 --> 02:47:40,833
<i>I am madly in love
with you Oh my dear.</i>

1855
02:47:42,125 --> 02:47:48,458
<i>I am madly in love with you.</i>

1856
02:47:49,750 --> 02:47:51,250
Forgive me, son.

1857
02:47:54,125 --> 02:47:58,542
I didn't realize how much
you both loved each other.

1858
02:48:01,417 --> 02:48:03,375
Don't be scared.

1859
02:48:05,125 --> 02:48:07,625
No one can separate the two of you.

1860
02:48:09,042 --> 02:48:10,125
That's not why I'm here.

1861
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:13,208
I came here to bless you.

1862
02:48:14,667 --> 02:48:15,667
God bless you.

1863
02:48:17,208 --> 02:48:18,208
God bless you.

1864
02:48:20,667 --> 02:48:21,667
Goodbye.

1865
02:48:22,042 --> 02:48:26,458
<i>I'll only walk on the path
That leads to you.</i>

1866
02:48:26,792 --> 02:48:31,208
<i>If you are with me,
I have nothing to fear</i>

1867
02:48:31,458 --> 02:48:33,375
<i>I'll only walk on the path.</i>

1868
02:48:33,542 --> 02:48:36,000
<i>That leads to you.</i>

1869
02:48:36,208 --> 02:48:41,708
<i>If you are with me,
I have nothing to fear.</i>

1870
02:48:41,917 --> 02:48:46,417
<i>We both will laugh and cry together.</i>

1871
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:49,875
<i>And prove it to everyone.</i>

1872
02:48:50,333 --> 02:48:53,792
<i>Oh my dear</i>

1873
02:48:54,042 --> 02:48:59,500
<i>I am madly in love with you.</i>

1874
02:48:59,750 --> 02:49:03,208
<i>Oh my dear</i>

1875
02:49:03,458 --> 02:49:08,708
<i>I am madly in love with you.</i>

1876
02:49:10,542 --> 02:49:15,542
<i>Oh my dear, I am madly in love with you.</i>

1877
02:49:17,542 --> 02:49:22,792
<i>Oh my dear, I am madly in love with you.</i>

1878
02:49:23,750 --> 02:49:26,042
<i>The girls are here, all dressed up.</i>

1879
02:49:26,125 --> 02:49:28,167
<i>They look great.</i>

1880
02:49:28,417 --> 02:49:32,208
<i>They are wearing golden earrings
And their arms are filled with bangles.</i>

1881
02:49:32,292 --> 02:49:37,458
<i>The girls are here, all dressed up.</i>

1882
02:49:37,875 --> 02:49:42,292
<i>They are wearing golden earrings
And their arms are filled with bangles</i>
