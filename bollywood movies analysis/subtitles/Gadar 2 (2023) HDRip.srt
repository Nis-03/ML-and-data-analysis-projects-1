1
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,000
"1947."

2
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,880
"In the massacre during
the partition..."

3
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
Anybody alive!

4
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,160
"Indians...
learn from us how to kill."

5
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,120
"Where thousands of families
were destroyed,"

6
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,000
"several families got
a new lease on life."

7
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
"One such family was
Tara Singh and Sakina."

8
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,000
Muslim!

9
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,880
You say she's a Muslim!

10
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,040
There. Now she will be a Sikh!

11
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,200
"All this wasn't as easy as it looked."

12
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,720
"Life was filled with happiness,"
"when one day..."

13
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,840
Our motherland, our people,
our country, is Pakistan.

14
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,920
"Facing several difficulties,"

15
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
"along his wife,
the mother of his child..."

16
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,400
You will not be given a visa.

17
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,440
Iqbal sir.

18
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,440
You think Tara can't go to Pakistan
without a single seal!

19
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,360
No power or border can stop me
from uniting my son with his mother!

20
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,200
Long live India!

21
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,120
"After teaching his father-in-law
Ashraf Ali a lesson in humanity,"

22
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,480
"Tara Singh brought Sakina
back to India."

23
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
"The swings are out again,"

24
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,880
"and the fruits have ripened."

25
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,640
"Life is short,"

26
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,800
"For India,
it was a matter of celebration."

27
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
"But in Pakistan..."

28
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,920
"politics had taken a different turn."

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
Hang Ashraf Ali!

30
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,720
Ashraf Ali's a traitor!

31
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
Hang Ashraf Ali!

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
Ashraf Ali's a traitor!

33
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,080
"How could Major Hamid Iqbal
take all this lying down?"

34
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,400
"Forty soldiers of his battalion
were dead."

35
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,760
"Because of a Hindu."

36
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,480
"Indians....whom."

37
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,360
"Indian...
whom he detested completely."

38
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,720
"Before the independence,"

39
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Hamid Iqbal was a captain
in the British Indian Army."

40
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,000
"And yet,
during the gory partition,"

41
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,920
"he couldn't save his family
from Indians."

42
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,360
*Praying.*

43
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,960
*Praying.*

44
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,240
"As a result,"
"hatred coursed through his veins."

45
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,040
"For Hindus and Indians."

46
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,040
"He had only one purpose in life."

47
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,440
"Gazwa-E-Hind"
(Invade and Conquer India)."

48
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,480
Mercy.

49
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,640
Sir, mercy.

50
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,120
Mercy has no value
in the eyes of religion.

51
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,600
My father and my mother begged
for mercy.

52
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
My siblings.

53
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,520
Your people killed all of them.

54
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
In Delhi.

55
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,760
That was your country.

56
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,320
You killed my men.

57
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,880
This is my country.

58
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,280
Now I will kill.

59
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,480
This is my country too.

60
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,520
For four generations--

61
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,760
Is this your country?

62
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,560
Fine.

63
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,440
Prove this is your country.

64
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,520
Captain.

65
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,680
Get it.

66
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,640
Gita.

67
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,920
Or Quran.

68
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,560
Sir, you all know about
the Tara Singh and Sakina case.

69
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,440
Tara Singh killed 40 soldiers
and fled to India.

70
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,600
And he was aided
by Sakina's father Ashraf Ali.

71
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,120
We are receiving backlashes
from everywhere, sir.

72
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,280
Please, have a look.

73
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,000
The politicians aren't taking any action,

74
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,280
nor is the army.

75
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,000
I want Ashraf Ali
to be sentenced to death.

76
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,840
"Even after getting
Ashraf Ali sentenced to death

77
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,480
He wasn not satisfied."

78
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,680
"He had another desire suppressed
in his heart."

79
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,600
"The desire to sentence the killer
of his men to death."

80
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,000
"But this was an impossible task."

81
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,880
"Because Tara Singh
was far beyond his reach,

82
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
some where in India."

83
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,080
"To be floored on someone's smile."

84
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,320
"To share someone's bane."

85
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,800
"To spread love..."

86
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,280
"To spread love..."

87
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,800
"Life is all about that."

88
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,720
Imtihaan, wake up.

89
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes, brother.

90
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,360
Yeah...

91
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,920
I was awake, brother.

92
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,360
"Curse you."

93
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,360
"What have you done?"

94
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,640
"I was sleeping, brother."

95
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,640
"But when I heard your voice,"

96
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,760
"I got up all of a sudden..."

97
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,920
"And this happened."

98
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,040
Exactly like his uncle Darmiyaan.

99
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,680
Brother, do we unload the goods
for the refugees or not?

100
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,560
Yes, unload it.

101
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,680
Get to work.

102
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,880
Right away, brother.

103
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,200
Sir, this General Hamid Iqbal
has lost his mind.

104
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,760
He's totally obsessed
with 'Ghazwa-E-Hind', sir.

105
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,880
His mortars have destroyed
our 'Kaali Mandir' Base completely.

106
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
War is inevitable, sir.

107
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,880
We'll infiltrate all the way
to Lahore and shoot him.

108
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
Once I spot him,

109
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,520
I am going to kill the bloody Idiot.

110
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,080
Roger, sir. Yes, sir.

111
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,320
Oh! Tara Singh ji.

112
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
Jai Hind, sir.

113
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,200
Come, please.

114
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,240
How are you, Tara Singh Ji?

115
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,200
I am great.

116
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,920
What about your family?

117
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,760
Your son?
Is he studying?

118
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,240
Children these days don't study.

119
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
They only watch films.

120
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,960
They have to watch
the first-day first show.

121
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,840
- Please, have a seat.
- But I've kept my son in check.

122
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,120
In check?

123
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,440
He's in my control.

124
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,040
What have you thought?

125
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,120
What do you want him to be?

126
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,480
Sir, I want him
to be an officer like you.

127
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,640
God willing.

128
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,320
Sir, why did you call me here?

129
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,960
I wanted to know
if your union can arrange 50 trucks.

130
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,880
Why not?

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Just give the orders.

132
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,240
No, not yet.

133
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,000
There are chances of war,
Tara Singh Ji.

134
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,560
I want a backup ready.

135
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,000
We are prepared, sir.

136
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,280
Whenever you say the word.

137
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,200
I know.

138
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,080
Thank you.

139
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,280
Okay, sir. Jai Hind.

140
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,440
Tara Singh Ji.

141
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,760
Your in-laws have sent something
for you.

142
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,520
My in-laws?

143
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,320
Usually, it's only arms and explosives.

144
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,800
This time they have sent some gifts.

145
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
Madam ji.

146
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,200
Madam ji.

147
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,080
Look what's arrived for you
from Sargodha.

148
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
Madam ji.

149
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,800
Tangerines from Sargodha!

150
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,640
Colonel sir sent these for you.

151
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,880
The colonel...

152
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are you hurt?

153
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,280
Here, eat.

154
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,560
What happened now?

155
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,600
With time,
your care for me keeps increasing.

156
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,600
Another thing that keeps increasing,
madam ji.

157
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,840
What is that?

158
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,080
My love for you.

159
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,600
Then sing for me again.

160
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,880
It's been so long.

161
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,320
"Fly away O bird,
with a candy in your beak."

162
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,320
"Fly away O bird,
with a candy in your beak."

163
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,120
"Convey my message,
and I'll be obliged."

164
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,840
"The swings are out again,"

165
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,160
"and the fruits have ripened."

166
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,960
"Life is short, nights are too long."

167
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,040
"Come home O traveller,"

168
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,360
"without you I am incomplete."

169
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,640
"Come home O traveller,"

170
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,560
"without you I am incomplete."

171
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,120
"Thus arrived the weather
of romantic songs."

172
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,640
"Thus arrived the weather
of romantic songs."

173
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,080
"Eyes lie in wait looking
for beloveds that have separated."

174
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,880
"Your memories keep me awake all night."

175
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,440
"All my songs are my heart's desires."

176
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,720
"Come home O traveller,"

177
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,000
"without you I am incomplete."

178
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,280
"Come home O traveller,"

179
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,520
"without you I am incomplete."

180
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,320
Bro, I've shined the car like a star.

181
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
Are we going or...

182
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,360
We're not going.
We're not going.

183
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,840
At least let me finish my song.

184
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,880
But, bro, we've to go.

185
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,160
Go where?

186
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,120
At Pishorilal's.
To make a delivery.

187
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,400
- Huh?
- Yes.

188
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
You go.

189
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,120
How can I go?

190
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,680
Is Jeetey at home?

191
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,320
He's at college.

192
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,000
What's so funny?

193
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,040
I was thinking whether...

194
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,160
I should tell you or not?

195
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,480
Say it.

196
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,440
But if I tell you,
Jeetey will beat me up.

197
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,160
Now I will beat you.

198
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
I prefer Jeetey.

199
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,040
Lately, he has been hanging
out at Sharda Bhavan.

200
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,760
With Ved Keemti Lal drama company.

201
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,640
Ved Keemti Lal is here?

202
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,640
Yes.

203
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
"I searched the entire universe."

204
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,040
"I never could find anyone like you..."

205
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,400
Wonderful!
Outstanding!

206
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,640
"I searched the entire universe."

207
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,360
Mahiwaal...enter!

208
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,000
"Handsome creation of God..."

209
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,280
"Honest and truthful."

210
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
My Soni, I am here.

211
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,040
- Enter, my boy.
- Mahi.

212
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,760
Come with me.

213
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,640
Let my Soni go, you bloody wretch.

214
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,600
- Mahi.
- Come with me now.

215
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,600
- She is mine.
- Hey...

216
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
I said she is mine.
She is my life.

217
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,800
Stop. Stop. Stop.

218
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,720
What are you doing, Jeetey?

219
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,080
Why are you speaking
in Dilip Kumar style, son?

220
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,120
Your dialogue should be heard
all the way to the last row.

221
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,360
This is a play.

222
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,480
Bring some pitch in your voice.

223
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,400
Pitch. Like Prithvi Raj Kapoor.

224
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,280
Right. Prithvi Raj Kapoor.

225
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,280
Here you go.

226
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,920
You wretch, let my Soni go.

227
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,840
Or else I will behead
you with my sword.

228
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,960
Mahi.

229
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,480
Don't touch her
or I will behead you right here.

230
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,800
Mahi.

231
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,840
Stop. Stop. Stop.

232
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
What are you doing, Jeetey?

233
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,840
What are you doing?

234
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,080
Mahiwaal was a lover.

235
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,200
He shouldn't be holding a sword.
But a flower.

236
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,200
- Yes.
- Flower.

237
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,920
He shouldn't be cursing.
He should be singing.

238
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Song.
Song. Okay, song.

239
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,880
Listen to me.

240
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
I want you to sing a song,

241
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,840
that leaves people in awe.

242
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,520
I will leave you in shock and awe.

243
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,520
Like two lovebirds free,

244
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,920
Like two lovebirds free,

245
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,120
Lovers are meant to be.

246
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,400
As your bird flees,
My bird is left to plea.

247
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
My bird is left to plea.

248
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
Like two lovebirds free,

249
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,960
Like two lovebirds--

250
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,480
Like two lovebirds free,

251
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,080
Father.

252
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Get down.

253
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,000
"He's in college," you said.

254
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,280
You didn't go to college?

255
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,800
And this?

256
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,080
What are you dressed as?

257
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,160
Mahwaal. Mahwaal.

258
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,080
He's busy being a lovebird!

259
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,760
keep telling everyone,
my son will be a successful man.

260
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,360
He will become an officer.

261
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,600
But look at him...

262
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,040
He'd be lucky if he could
become a truck driver.

263
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,240
He's been missing college for 10 days.

264
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
What?

265
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,840
What?

266
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,400
What?

267
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,120
Don't pretend you don't know.

268
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,760
Where are your books?

269
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,480
Where else but in my room?

270
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,560
Such attitude.

271
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,920
He hasn't even read his books.

272
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,800
Tara ji is right, son.
You need to study.

273
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't want to study.

274
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,440
- You are going to study...
- Tara.

275
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,040
See...you are spoiling him.

276
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,240
Over here. Come over here.

277
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Let go of her hand.

278
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,280
Keep him locked
in the room all day.

279
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,160
No food for him.

280
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,480
- I will fix him.
- But...

281
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,840
I will fix him.

282
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,000
Close!

283
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,800
Come on.
Come here.

284
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,640
Uncle's friend Keshav lives
in Chandigarh.

285
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,320
I'll speak to him
and get him into a hostel.

286
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Hostel, Tara ji?
So far away.

287
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,920
Why not?
Even you studied at a hostel.

288
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,440
And look what you became -
a madam ji.

289
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,720
Even he will become an officer.

290
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,360
I am not going to Chandigarh.

291
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,560
- I'll see how you won't go.
- Oh! Tara ji.

292
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,800
What--

293
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,840
What are you guys looking at?

294
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,400
Scram!

295
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,280
See...that's the company he keeps.

296
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,480
This company is what spoiled him.

297
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,720
I will break your legs
if you don't study.

298
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,320
Stop. Stop it, both of you.

299
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
Look, don't feed him until
he doesn't study.

300
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,400
- Okay?
- Okay.

301
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,160
Okay, Tara ji.

302
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
What are you looking at?

303
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,440
I am hungry.

304
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,320
What took you so long to get the food?

305
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,320
I am starving.

306
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Yes, of course.

307
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,560
You are extra hungry today.

308
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,760
Naughty boy.

309
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,560
You are the mother of a strong,
budding young man.

310
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,120
I feel hungry after every two hours.
Come on, feed me.

311
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,240
Shut up and eat.

312
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,320
I have to come up
with several excuses for you.

313
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
It's a sin.

314
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
Feeding a hungry person is not a sin.

315
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,800
It's a good deed.

316
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,160
Your enemies will starve.

317
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Hamid Iqbal?

318
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,120
Jeetey. Get this out of your mind.

319
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
Why?
He hung my grandpa,

320
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,720
and granny died from grief.

321
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,520
And I cannot even talk about it?

322
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,680
You think I am a kid.

323
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,320
Jeetey, stop thinking about all this.

324
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,480
I want to know,

325
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,320
why haven't you attended college
for 10 days.

326
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,920
Nor tuitions.

327
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,120
Don't you care about
your father's feelings?

328
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,360
And what about my feelings?

329
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,640
I told you weeks ago,

330
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,600
Bittu and Pradyuman's fathers
bought a motorcycle for them.

331
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,560
Every day they--

332
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,400
Motorcycle. Motorcycle. Motorcycle.

333
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
Quickly. Wipe your mouth.

334
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,280
The chances of a war are growing.

335
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,640
We have to go dig, trenches.

336
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,360
to escape the bombings.

337
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,040
Like we did in '65 war.

338
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,880
One thing confuses me.

339
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,480
People over there want peace,

340
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,320
even we want peace.

341
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,720
But these politicians make things worse.

342
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,520
Come on. Eat.

343
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,120
- Am I right?
- Absolutely.

344
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,160
Eat your food.

345
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,240
Did you feed Jeetey?

346
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,400
You said no food for him.

347
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,240
Even if I did,
you didn't have to starve him.

348
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,280
What kind of a mother are you?

349
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,160
Keep seated.
I will feed him.

350
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,640
You have a meeting, don't you?

351
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
My son is studying.

352
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,360
Sit down.

353
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,040
Son.

354
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,360
Eat some food.

355
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,760
I am studying.
Don't disturb me.

356
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,400
Son, I made a mistake.

357
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,840
Please eat it.

358
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,800
I don't want to eat it.

359
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,320
Let it be. I'll feed him.

360
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,920
I'll see how he doesn't eat.

361
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,240
Trying to act smart with me.

362
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,040
Telling me he doesn't want to eat.

363
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,640
You dropped some food
on the book too.

364
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,040
Son...

365
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,240
you don't know how happy I am today.

366
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,560
Sometimes I get worried.

367
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,680
Do you want me
to keep studying like this?

368
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,320
Why not?

369
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,400
Then I am going to stay with you.

370
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,840
Yes. You are not going anywhere.

371
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,040
Then get me a motorcycle.

372
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,760
Son...ask for something else.

373
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,920
No motorcycle.

374
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,280
It's prone to accidents.

375
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,800
No. No motorcycle.

376
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,360
All my friends have a motorcycle.

377
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,480
I am only asking for a motorcycle.

378
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Get him one.

379
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,560
Okay.

380
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,480
But I have a condition.

381
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,800
You have to secure first rank.

382
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,320
- First rank?
- Hmm.

383
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,840
- Me?
- Yes

384
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,680
Only one out of forty
boys gets first rank.

385
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,440
Just say it if you don't want
to buy it for me.

386
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,800
You can be that one among forty.

387
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,280
What is this?

388
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,680
Dharmendra.

389
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,280
Jeetey!

390
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,800
Stop. Stop right there.

391
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,760
Is this what you call studying?

392
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,040
Father, I...

393
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,280
What father?

394
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,040
You are going to Chandigarh.

395
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,320
You will study there
and become an officer.

396
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,080
I won't go to Chandigarh.

397
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,000
I will go to Mumbai
and become an actor.

398
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,320
Tara.

399
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,080
My knees are aching from sitting
there for such a long time.

400
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
I don't want to stay here.

401
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,160
What happened?

402
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,440
Why are you hitting my son?

403
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,400
Come here, Jeetey.

404
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,040
- Jeetey? Where are you going, son?
- What happened?

405
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,040
Had your uncle been still alive,

406
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,440
you wouldn't dare to do this.

407
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,720
Aunty, he doesn't study.

408
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,120
He's only obsessed with films.

409
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Even you used to see films.

410
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,560
Don't you?

411
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,280
And you used to sing all day
"Let the heart burn."

412
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,480
You had your share of fun
when you were young.

413
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
This is his time to have fun,
so let him.

414
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,320
Let him watch films.

415
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
Look at what happened to me.

416
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,800
I became a truck driver.

417
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,840
I don't want him
to become a truck driver--

418
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,440
No. I am taking him
to Chandigarh tomorrow itself.

419
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,960
He will stay at the hostel
and become an officer.

420
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,520
Brother. It's his birthday today.

421
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,160
We returned three days earlier
from our pilgrimage,

422
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,320
only to celebrate his birthday.

423
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
And you say he leaves
for Chandigarh tomorrow.

424
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,920
- Right.
- Leave it, grandma.

425
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,080
He only remembers that
I am useless, good-for-nothing.

426
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,240
He keeps humiliating me.

427
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,400
- Slapping me in front of my friends.
- Tara!

428
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,160
Keeps telling me to study all the time.

429
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,760
Heard that?

430
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,280
Am I saying anything wrong, son?

431
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,840
I don't want to celebrate my birthday.

432
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,720
- Son. Jeetey.
- Where are you going?

433
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,760
Jeetey.

434
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,040
Your father is not wrong, son.

435
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,280
Are you happy now?

436
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,680
Want to go for a ride?

437
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,640
"I set out...on my vehicle."

438
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,040
"I set out...on my vehicle."

439
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,440
"On the roads and streets..."

440
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,080
"I came to a turn,"

441
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,840
"where I lost my heart."

442
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,560
"I came to a turn,"

443
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,280
"where I lost my heart."

444
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,120
"God knows when I passed Amritsar,"

445
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,480
"and when I arrived in Lahore."

446
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,280
"I lost my heart."

447
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,000
"I came to a turn,"

448
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,680
"where I lost my heart."

449
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,040
"I met my companion at that turn."

450
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,560
"I met my companion at that turn."

451
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,840
"This Jat lost his heart."

452
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:27,120
"I fell asleep under
the cool shade of her tresses."

453
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,440
"When I woke up, I ran."

454
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:36,360
"Breaking all barricades and signals."

455
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,080
"I lost my heart."

456
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,960
"I came to a turn,"

457
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,240
"where I lost my heart."

458
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,080
"She blushed and flinched."

459
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,520
"She blushed and flinched."

460
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,800
"The moment she woke up from her sleep,"

461
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,000
"I told her, listen to me, dear."

462
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,000
"She got scared and ran behind."

463
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,400
"She thought,"

464
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,720
"a thief had creeped,

465
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,360
"or sneaked into her house."

466
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,760
"I lost my heart."

467
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,800
"I came to a turn,"

468
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,560
"where I lost my heart."

469
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,280
"I came to a turn,"

470
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,040
"where I lost my heart."

471
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,800
"I came to a turn,"

472
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,600
"where I lost my heart."

473
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,320
"I came to a turn,"

474
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,160
"where I lost my heart."

475
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,760
Want to go to Bombay?

476
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
Become a hero?

477
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,640
First go to Chandigarh
and finish your studies.

478
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,200
I am missing our son.

479
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,600
It's been only a month,
but feels like years.

480
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,400
I was thinking about that too.

481
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,000
Whenever I would go
to the hostel to study,

482
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,520
mom and dad must've felt very lonely.

483
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,360
Right?

484
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,720
Mom once told me...

485
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,160
When I separated
from my parents during the partition,

486
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,000
father would stay up all night crying.

487
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,480
Honestly...life seems incomplete
without children.

488
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,720
Isn't it?

489
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,400
Then let's go to Chandigarh.

490
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,440
Hello.

491
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yes.

492
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Yes, he's here.

493
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,920
Brother, it's the captain on the line.

494
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,000
The colonel wants to speak to you.

495
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,320
The enemy's action is well intended.

496
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,800
They want to take over Ram Tekdi, sir.

497
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,160
Sir, this feature will serve
him a bloody firm base.

498
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,160
Sir, they have destroyed
all our vehicles.

499
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,200
Sir, we can't get the ammunition there.

500
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,800
We need reinforcements.

501
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,320
Major, control yourself.

502
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,680
Sir, it's difficult to control.

503
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,360
My boys are dying without ammunition.

504
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,120
- I wish we have the obstacle system was like DCB.
- Colonel GS has called up.

505
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,440
Air support tonight is not possible.

506
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Can I speak to Bhargav?

507
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,680
Thank you.

508
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,480
Bhargav, I am sending CHTs.

509
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,480
CHTs?

510
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,160
That's the only option I had, my boy.

511
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,160
Keep fighting.
Don't give up.

512
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,200
Reinforcements are coming
from the DMA.

513
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,320
But tonight...

514
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,160
The platoon's honour is in your hands.

515
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,520
- Got it?
- Got it, sir.

516
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,880
- Got it?
- Got it, sir.

517
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Come on, buck up!

518
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,880
Sir, the CHTs have arrived.

519
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,760
Oh, fantastic.

520
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,160
Load the ammunition.

521
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,080
Who is in charge of them?

522
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,880
What is your name?

523
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,400
Tara Singh, sir.

524
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,520
The firing from enemy mortars
and rifles shows no signs of ceasing.

525
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
You can hear them, right?

526
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,360
You have to dodge the shelling,

527
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,720
and deliver the ammunition
to our soldiers.

528
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
You won't get scared, will you?

529
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,280
Sir, maybe you don't know
who Tara Singh is.

530
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
You should ask the enemy
who Tara Singh is.

531
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,600
See you, sir.

532
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
Load the ammunition!

533
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,560
Go.

534
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,440
Here, take them quickly.

535
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,120
Move, move, move.
Hurry.

536
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,840
Here, catch.

537
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,600
Kuljeet, we got the ammunition.

538
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,880
Load your guns.
Load your guns now.

539
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,320
Nara-e-takbir!

540
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
Allah-o-Akbar!

541
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Baldev!

542
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,160
Alpha One for Charlie
heavy vehicle advancing towards us.

543
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,280
Sir, our plan has failed.

544
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,400
We cannot take over Ram Tekdi now.

545
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
The infidels have received ammunition.

546
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,880
Tara Singh?

547
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,800
With the grace of Allah,
I finally found you.

548
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,800
I looked all over for you.

549
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,800
Now everyone will be looking for you.

550
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,080
Let the enemy think they are winning,
and let them come forward.

551
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,480
You keep falling back.

552
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
Retreat.

553
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,240
- Brigadier Salim.
- Sir.

554
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,920
Let's play some war games.

555
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,480
Glory to India!

556
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,720
Har Har Mahadev!

557
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,600
Jai Bhavani!

558
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,600
Har Har Mahadev!

559
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,840
Fire.

560
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,480
- Please be a little patient.
- Mom.

561
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,240
- Why aren't you give us any information?
- Mom.

562
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,160
Mom, father?

563
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,160
My Tara Singh is okay.

564
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,000
Tara is on the hill.

565
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,160
Helping people.

566
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,240
He will be fine.

567
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,040
Please be a little patient.

568
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,640
I can understand your emotion.

569
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,760
Please allow us.

570
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,520
We want to go take
a look ourselves on the hills.

571
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,640
I can't allow you
to anywhere, ma'am.

572
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,560
Who told you this incident occurred
on the hill?

573
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,560
It occurred on the other side
of the hill.

574
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,200
Do you have any idea
how dangerous and volatile it is?

575
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,200
Can't you hear the shelling?

576
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,440
Do you know how many men,

577
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,440
how many lives are at stake here?

578
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,960
My own officer Major Bhargav
is right now--

579
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,880
Colonel.

580
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,880
I need to speak to the Div.
Headquarters right away.

581
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
The matter will go up to the UNO.

582
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,520
Five of our men and three CHT drivers

583
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,320
have been captured by the enemy.

584
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,840
According to intelligence information,

585
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,360
Indian Army's Major Bhargav,
Capt. Tiwari,

586
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,400
Subedaar Prakash,

587
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,640
two other army soldiers,
driver Pooran Singh,

588
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,120
Ranjeet, Tara Singh...

589
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,040
These seven people are
in Pakistan's captivity.

590
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,800
But the Pakistani army
has denied these claims,

591
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,480
and accused the Indian army
of infiltration.

592
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,760
The Pakistani government is also denying

593
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,400
any prisoner of war.

594
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,520
The government even goes on to say,

595
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,080
they are either missing in action

596
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,920
or died in the encounter.

597
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,240
Again and again
the same bloody question.

598
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Madam, we are in a war-like situation.

599
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,680
Don't you get it?

600
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,000
And I am already in war.

601
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,160
Don't you get it?

602
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,840
Please, calm down.

603
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,440
You must understand
her situation as well.

604
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,600
She deserves to know the truth.

605
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,280
Whether he's actually
in their captivity or...

606
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,440
We understand, sir.

607
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,640
I am telling you this again.

608
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,640
Don't worry, we're doing our job.

609
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,640
But nobody is above the country.

610
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,640
We know the enemy here.
We all do, don't we?

611
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,240
We're constantly in touch with the UNO.

612
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,160
The circumstances are such,

613
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,280
that we need to be prepared
for all kinds of eventualities here.

614
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,560
We need to be prepared
for all kinds of eventualities.

615
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,400
Mom.

616
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,520
Allah...nothing can happen to my Tara.

617
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,960
Mom.

618
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,440
Allah...nothing can happen to my Tara.

619
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,400
Pull yourself together, mom.

620
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,040
- Tara will come back.
- Mom, pull yourself together.

621
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,880
"O beloved, don't sever
this bond and leave me."

622
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:42,040
"O beloved, don't sever
this bond and leave me."

623
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,440
"I forsake the world,
but don't leave me."

624
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,960
"That can never happen,"

625
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,240
"don't be afraid if it does."

626
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,880
"I will come running back on your call."

627
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,440
"Come home O traveller,"

628
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,760
"without youI am incomplete."

629
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,040
"Come home O traveller,"

630
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,920
"without you I am incomplete."

631
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,640
"Come home O beloved traveller."

632
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,920
"Come home O beloved traveller."

633
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,280
"Come home O beloved traveller."

634
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,520
"I will be grateful to God."

635
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,840
"Come home O beloved traveller."

636
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,160
"Come home O beloved traveller."

637
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,400
"Come home O beloved traveller."

638
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,720
"I will be grateful to God."

639
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,000
"Come home O beloved traveller."

640
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,280
"Come home O beloved traveller."

641
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,560
"Come home O beloved traveller."

642
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,880
"I will be grateful to God."

643
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,160
"Come home O beloved traveller."

644
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,400
"Come home O beloved traveller."

645
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,680
"Come home O beloved traveller."

646
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,040
"I will be grateful to God."

647
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,920
Mohammad Gul Khan.

648
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,800
Next to Baba Chote Shah's shrine.

649
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,360
Lahore, Pakistan.

650
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,280
"He alone is brave,"

651
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:03,080
"who fights for the one in need."

652
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:10,400
"He may get cut into pieces,"

653
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,760
"But he will never leave
the battlefield."

654
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,400
"He alone is brave,"

655
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,320
"He alone is brave,"

656
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,880
"He alone is brave,"

657
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,120
"He alone is brave,"

658
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,680
"If you want to play the game of love,"

659
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,080
"Then step onto my path with
your head on the palm."

660
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,400
"If you want to play the game of love,"

661
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,240
"Then step onto my path
with your head on the palm."

662
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,440
"When you place your feet on this path,"

663
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,680
"Give Me your head,
and do not listen to what others say."

664
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,920
"When you place your feet on this path,"

665
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,600
"Give Me your head,
and do not listen to what others say."

666
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:12,160
"He may get cut into pieces,"

667
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,360
"But he will never leave
the battlefield."

668
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,440
"But he will never leave
the battlefield."

669
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,120
Keep your belongings,
your passport and visa in your hand.

670
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,000
Indian spies are infiltrating
us using forged documents.

671
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,280
Is anyone of those bastards here?

672
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,200
Everybody, get off the bus now.

673
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,720
Here. You may go.

674
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,840
Thank you, sir.

675
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,840
Next.

676
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,040
224853.

677
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,000
Forward line of all troupes--

678
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,600
- Wahid Khan.
- Yes, sir.

679
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,320
- From Lucknow, are you?
- Yes.

680
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,160
I see.

681
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,000
I've heard you people
are treated unfairly.

682
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,880
That's not true, sir.

683
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,040
Except for a few handful incidents,

684
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,520
it's very peaceful out there.

685
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,800
Peaceful, is it?

686
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,560
Come with me.

687
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,600
Go on.

688
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,840
Next.

689
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,840
Come, mister. Come here.

690
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,320
- He says it's very peaceful there.
- What is wrong?

691
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,640
What is the matter, sir?

692
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,960
I am a Muslim.

693
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,480
Every Muslim who thinks
he's lucky to be living in India,

694
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,840
deserves this.

695
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,880
Malik.

696
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,640
Come on.
You say it's peaceful.

697
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,240
And you call yourself a Muslim.

698
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,080
And you praise the infidels.

699
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
And you call yourself a Muslim.

700
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,560
True Muslim.

701
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,480
Go.

702
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,160
Passport.

703
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,600
Passport!

704
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,000
Ashfaq.

705
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
Ashfaq.

706
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,400
Yes...yes, sir.

707
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,640
Isn't that your name?

708
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,600
Yes, sir.

709
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,240
And I am a Pakistani.

710
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,520
I live in Multan.

711
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,320
I had gone to Aligarh at my uncle's place.

712
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,560
For my aunt's wedding.

713
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,840
Amazing. Amazing.

714
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,720
By the way,

715
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,000
what do those infidels say
about Pakistan.

716
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,160
You better not ask, sir.

717
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,440
What do they say?

718
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,840
Promise me you won't get mad at me.

719
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,480
What do they say?!

720
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,320
The Indian army says that Pakistani army
is a bunch of cowards.

721
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,400
They don't have any respect for you.

722
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,680
They say we defeated them in '48,
again in '65.

723
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,800
If we go to war again,
we'll defeat them again.

724
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,880
And build a new Bangladesh.

725
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Enough!

726
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,360
Have you heard about
Major General Hamid Iqbal?

727
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,920
Yes.

728
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,160
Yes, sir.

729
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,040
We had a small encounter at Ram Tekdi.

730
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,640
He blew them up.

731
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,920
If we go to war again,

732
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,880
we'll break them into pieces.

733
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,240
We'll soak their lands red,

734
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,520
and their flag in green.

735
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,400
If we go to war, sir.

736
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,720
Then you will experience
my blood boil too.

737
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,760
I will bathe the enemy
in their own blood.

738
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,320
So be it.

739
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,320
So be it!

740
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,560
The youngsters of Pakistan are amazing.

741
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,560
Bravo.

742
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,720
Goodbye, sir.

743
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,000
Who was that boy that just left here?

744
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,480
And who are you?

745
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,160
Major Anwar Ali, ISI.

746
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,120
Give me a copy of his passport, quick.

747
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,080
You got to be kidding me, son.

748
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,320
The ISI can sniff anyone out like a dog.

749
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,000
They will investigate you.

750
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,400
Get your entire details out.

751
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,240
And if they learn...

752
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,920
that you are Tara Singh's son
then you're as good as dead.

753
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,040
So take my advice, son,

754
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,160
eat something and go back to India.

755
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,840
Without my father?

756
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,600
Whenever I see tears
in my mother's eyes,

757
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,560
I want to set the world on fire.

758
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,000
I fear nothing.

759
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,520
I'll deal with whatever comes my way.

760
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,800
You got to be kidding me, son.

761
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,040
Have these Lahori Chole-Bhature first.

762
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,160
You won't stop licking your fingers.

763
00:53:59,280 --> 00:53:59,960
Here.

764
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,240
Tell me about my father.

765
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,200
Any news?

766
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,320
Son, since I received your letter,

767
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,560
I've been busy gathering information
about your father.

768
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,200
The first thing I did,

769
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,920
was send your uncouth aunt home
with her idiot sons.

770
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,560
And then General Rani...

771
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,080
General Rani is a popular courtesan.

772
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,600
- From General--
- Tell me about my father.

773
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,920
I am telling you about your father.

774
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,720
Tell me.

775
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,360
General Rani is the one true queen.

776
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,240
So I made friends with her cook,

777
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,920
treated him to English liquor,

778
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,360
and got him to spill all the secrets.

779
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,680
Understood?

780
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,360
So I found out...

781
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,200
Some Indian soldiers and truck drivers

782
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,040
were captured from the Pathankot border.

783
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,680
They have been locked away.

784
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,920
Hidden.
Secret.

785
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,240
One thing is clear, son.

786
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,920
My friend is alive.

787
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,560
"And the other news is,"

788
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,240
"They are all being held
in Kot Lakhpat jail."

789
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,200
"Mom...do you know,

790
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,760
I met granduncle."

791
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,960
"With his help,"

792
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,640
I got hold of the map of
Kot Lakhpat jail."

793
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,280
"And found out that father
and the other POWs,"

794
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,480
"are being kept
in a high secretive cell,

795
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,840
let alone no ordinary inmate,"

796
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,720
"even human rights and the red cross
aren't allowed here."

797
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,360
"Getting there is impossible."

798
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,440
"But I will."

799
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,080
"I will bring my father back."

800
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,560
"Don't worry."

801
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,200
"As grandma always says,"

802
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,520
"when all doors are closed,

803
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,880
God opens new doors."

804
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,480
O' Jeetey, my baby.

805
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,800
"My eyes seek you..."

806
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,440
Farid.

807
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,080
We were supposed to meet here
after the prayer meeting.

808
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,720
Sultan bhai is here from Muslimpura.

809
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,240
Greetings, Mr. Khan.

810
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,400
Greetings, Ranger.

811
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,920
He's brought some consignment
from the cross border.

812
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,200
I am just tallying the goods.

813
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,440
Tell Muskaan to take care of this job.

814
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,720
Muskaan hasn't returned from college--

815
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,800
Father. Father...it was a great day today.

816
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,480
Muskaan is back.

817
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,320
Come here, my child.

818
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,680
Father. Father. Father...

819
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,040
- You know my friend Rihana.
- Yes.

820
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,400
Her brother Murtuza went
to Bombay, India.

821
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,840
So this time I asked him,

822
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,480
to get me a photograph
and autograph of Rajesh Khanna.

823
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,240
See. Dear, Muskaan.

824
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,720
Father, please let me meet
Rajesh Khanna once.

825
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,200
I'll do anything you say.

826
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,760
But meeting Rajesh Khanna
in these conditions is impossible.

827
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,560
Uncle, you know
I can do anything for my father.

828
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,600
Listen to me.

829
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,920
Listen to me first.

830
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,160
Abdul Ali and Gullu
has brought a new cook.

831
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,280
Go and meet him.

832
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,720
I am going over
to General Rani's place.

833
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,240
That Gullu must have brought
some idiot again, father.

834
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,240
I am not doing it.

835
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,080
We have no other option, dear.

836
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,240
Eid is around the corner.
Orders are pouring in.

837
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,080
And we are short of cooks.

838
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,080
- Okay, fine...fine.
- Okay then. We'll get going.

839
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,560
Was Major Anwar from the ISI here?

840
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,360
Yeah, so?

841
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,120
He's got pictures
of some Indian spy again.

842
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,480
Did you take a look at their faces?

843
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,520
We all look the same.

844
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,520
Whether it's on this side or that side.

845
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,200
Before the partition,
we used to live together peacefully.

846
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,440
But only God can save us now.

847
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,840
And yes. Stick it over there.

848
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,840
And check the new cook thoroughly.

849
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,400
- Fine.
- Let's go, mister.

850
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,720
Rehman. Get the knife.

851
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,760
What if it's your picture?

852
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,680
Anwar Ali has seen you.

853
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,840
I think it's my picture.

854
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,960
Then let's get out of here, Jeetey.

855
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,920
But where will we go?

856
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,480
Kurbaan Khan has already seen me.

857
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,680
You said if I get this job,

858
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,080
it will be easier for me
to get to my father.

859
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,240
So I must get this job.

860
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,080
But how, Jeetey? How?

861
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,240
Hey...

862
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,000
Excuse me.

863
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,280
Can I give you a hand?

864
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,200
This is Ashfaq.

865
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,560
My nephew.

866
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,800
- He is a really good cook.
- Yes, he is.

867
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,240
Once you taste his biryani,

868
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,680
then you'll never stop licking
your fingers.

869
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,480
I see...
so I need to test this Indian hero.

870
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,440
Indian hero?

871
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,040
Judging by your style,
you look just like Rajesh Khanna.

872
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,240
Even you look nothing short of Mumtaz.

873
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,120
Uh-huh?

874
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,240
- Listen.
- yes.

875
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,560
He's come all the way from Multan.

876
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,360
Especially for this job.

877
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,080
If he gets the job,

878
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,040
it will be a big load off our chest.

879
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,520
And what about him?

880
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,040
Test me.

881
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,560
Come on.

882
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,000
By the way, I want to dedicate
a few lines to your beauty.

883
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,400
Go ahead.

884
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,640
Your beauty rivals Taj's grand fame,

885
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,400
Your beauty rivals Taj's grand fame,

886
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,760
You are so enchanting,

887
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,760
I wonder what's your name.

888
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,520
They call me God's grace,
flowers' golden hour,

889
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,080
- Oh.
- They call me God's grace,

890
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,800
flowers' golden hour,

891
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,800
They call me Muskaan,
my beauty empowers.

892
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,880
By the way, you seem
a fan of Hindi films.

893
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,520
Not more than you.

894
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,640
What do you think of Saira Banu?

895
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,240
Honestly speaking...

896
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,520
not more beautiful than you.

897
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,360
You have a way with words.

898
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,920
From your attitude, gait and speech,

899
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,120
you don't look like a cook.

900
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,320
- What?
- See...got you.

901
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,400
You didn't tell me your real purpose.

902
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,880
Do you want to know the truth?

903
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,160
I don't expect it,

904
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,840
but please do.

905
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,000
What's keeping you?

906
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,480
Coming.

907
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,280
Coming.

908
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,000
You didn't tell me yet.

909
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,200
I want to go to jail.

910
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,040
What?

911
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,320
After getting beaten up by you.

912
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,920
So that my name's
on the list of your lovers.

913
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,440
Allah.

914
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,240
By the way, jokes apart.

915
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,520
The truth is I am an actor,

916
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,160
and I came here looking
for a job to act.

917
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,880
Actor? You?

918
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,000
Exactly. Like Rajesh Khanna, Devanand.

919
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,960
I want this job to make ends meet,
on the side.

920
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,000
Understood?

921
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,840
I know the initial steps
to make a biryani.

922
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,480
You can teach me the rest.

923
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,880
I need to make the ends meet, you see.

924
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,960
Please.

925
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,280
Do you act like you make biryani?

926
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,720
Seriously?

927
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,440
Do you have an earthen pot?

928
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,200
There, in the storeroom.

929
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,520
Shall I get it for you?

930
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,840
I can get it myself.

931
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,080
Mister, couldn't find the pot yet?

932
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,160
Coming. Just looking for the pot.

933
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,280
Coming.

934
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,520
Do I get the job?

935
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,000
This is Hotel Kamyaab.

936
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,200
Getting a job here isn't easy.

937
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,200
You keep singing
and I'll keep thinking.

938
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:02,440
"The passion, the mischief,"

939
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,160
"Finesses and exquisiteness,"

940
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,680
"The passion, the mischief,"

941
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,440
"Finesses and exquisiteness,"

942
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,040
"You are beautiful..."

943
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,600
"You are beautiful..."

944
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,240
"From head to toe."

945
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:30,640
"My heart sways...it sways."

946
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:37,840
"My heart sways...it sways."

947
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:45,160
"Like an angel...
an angel it sees you."

948
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,680
"My heart sways...it sways."

949
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:57,800
"My heart can't stop swaying."

950
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,920
"Your attitude is unique."

951
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,240
"My heart's a fan of yours."

952
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:22,160
"Your tresses are as black
as the cloud."

953
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,320
"Like the cool shade under the sun."

954
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,960
"Your eyes shower me with grace,"

955
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,240
"I feel blessed."

956
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:40,440
"How can I forget...your blessings."

957
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,160
"You are beautiful..."

958
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,720
"You are beautiful..."

959
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,040
"From head to toe."

960
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:57,720
"My heart sways...it sways."

961
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:04,800
"My heart sways...it sways."

962
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:12,160
"Like an angel...
an angel it sees you."

963
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,800
"My heart sways...it sways."

964
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:24,800
"My heart can't stop swaying."

965
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,240
"Every word seems like wishes,"

966
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,840
"you finally included me in them."

967
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:06,840
"Finally I've achieved
a part of your heart."

968
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,320
"Your heart is just like you."

969
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,640
"It's making me happy."

970
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:22,040
"Wherever you go,
you spread light."

971
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,680
"You are beautiful..."

972
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,360
"You are beautiful..."

973
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,920
"From head to toe."

974
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:39,320
"My heart sways...it sways."

975
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:46,400
"My heart sways...it sways."

976
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:53,840
"Like an angel...
an angel it sees you."

977
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,360
"My heart sways...it sways."

978
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:06,320
"My heart can't stop swaying."

979
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:15,560
"My heart can't stop swaying."

980
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,640
"God doesn't create faces like
this anymore."

981
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,200
"From which you can't take
your eyes off."

982
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,800
"One that brings peace
to your heart."

983
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,080
"You are beautiful..."

984
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,640
"From head to toe."

985
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,200
Mom, everything is fine now.

986
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,360
I got the job.

987
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,880
I am very close to father.

988
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,560
Just wait till Eid.

989
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,320
All our happiness will return.

990
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,160
Farid.

991
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,640
Did you make preparations
for Kot Lakhpat Jail?

992
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,760
Yes, father.

993
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,800
You, Muskaan, Fauzia, Akram along
with seven other people.

994
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,480
Did you include him?

995
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,480
No, father. He's been included
on General Rani's team.

996
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,680
Son, he's been requesting me
for three days,

997
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,680
to be included on this team.

998
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,800
Oh yes.

999
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,920
He said he was writing
some story on jails.

1000
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,560
Take him along.

1001
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,400
This way the poor boy can
complete his research.

1002
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,040
So...?

1003
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Father, I am coming.

1004
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,320
Allah...look at your tears.

1005
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,160
Thank you.

1006
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,240
Thanks to you, I can complete my story.

1007
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,560
And...my story?

1008
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,160
Eidi (gift).

1009
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,680
Eidi (gift)?

1010
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,320
I need to get ready Kot Lakhpat--

1011
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,680
I have decided.

1012
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,000
This year for Eidi,

1013
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,160
I will ask father for this new cook.

1014
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:14,360
Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi
and the President of Pakistan are...

1015
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,640
Yes, father.

1016
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,800
Hurry up, child.
Get those 12 pots loaded.

1017
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,520
But Asfaq was supposed to do that.

1018
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,280
We always had our doubts about him.

1019
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,000
He's been missing since last night.

1020
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,480
Okay, father.
I'll take care of it.

1021
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,440
Yes, hurry up.

1022
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,920
Such weird kids.

1023
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,880
"We were in love,"

1024
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
"We were meant to be together,"

1025
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,360
"So many things were left untold,"

1026
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,160
Tomorrow at Eid,
she will talk to her father

1027
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,360
about marrying me.

1028
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,520
What?

1029
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,840
What are you saying?

1030
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,880
I made a big mistake.

1031
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,080
I should have never chosen this path.

1032
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,040
I have no right to play
with anyone's life.

1033
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,840
For my personal gains.

1034
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,720
She is innocent.

1035
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,400
I must find another way...

1036
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,520
"So many things were left untold,"

1037
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:19,840
"The saga...of our love."

1038
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,120
It's a good thing you are here.

1039
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,320
Maybe I could have never
told you this personally.

1040
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,320
My name isn't Asfaq.
It's Jeetey.

1041
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,680
Charanjeet Singh.

1042
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,200
Charanjeet Singh.

1043
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,640
I was on one of those posters.

1044
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,880
I came from India
on a fake passport and visa,

1045
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,600
to find my father.

1046
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,120
To get him out of here.

1047
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,760
He's locked away in Kot Lakhpat jail,

1048
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,880
without any reason or crime.

1049
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,200
"Meant to be together,"

1050
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,040
You could do your duty as a Pakistani.

1051
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,920
Don't worry about me.

1052
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,720
I am Tara Singh's son.

1053
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,280
Under every circumstance,

1054
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,120
I will do my duty as a son.

1055
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:33,640
"That was a moment to rejoice."

1056
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:38,920
"And this is a moment of sorrow."

1057
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,840
Muskaan.

1058
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,440
"A life wasted away,"

1059
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,800
My name isn't Asfaq.
It's Jeetey.

1060
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,040
Charanjeet Singh.

1061
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,080
You could do your duty as a Pakistani.

1062
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:59,640
"A life meant to be spent together,"

1063
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:06,920
"Meant to be spent together,"

1064
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,160
Just once...

1065
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,400
Swear on me and say
you are not an Indian spy.

1066
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,600
And you just came here looking
for your father.

1067
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,760
I swear I'll cross 100 seas,

1068
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,760
to unite you with your father.

1069
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,240
Do you see anything but the truth
in my eyes?

1070
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:17,560
"Whatever your decision might be."

1071
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:25,080
"Just let me know."

1072
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:35,440
"Whatever is in my destiny."

1073
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:42,520
"Unite me with that person."

1074
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:48,280
"Unite me. Unite me."

1075
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,120
"Unite me."

1076
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:59,160
"Unite me."

1077
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:04,200
"Every time I open my eyes,"

1078
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:11,560
"after prayers,"

1079
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:18,360
"show me the face,"

1080
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:24,960
"of my loved one."

1081
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:31,760
"Unite me."

1082
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:56,040
"Let's be destroyed once again."

1083
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:04,040
"Let's be destroyed once again."

1084
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:10,320
"Let's fall in love with you."

1085
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:19,160
"Let's fall in love with you."

1086
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,560
"Let's get shattered again."

1087
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:36,000
"Let's get shattered again."

1088
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:41,920
"Let's fall in love with you."

1089
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:51,480
"Let's fall in love with you."

1090
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,760
"The promise my heart made to you,"

1091
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,280
"is known only by me or my God."

1092
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,600
"The promise my heart made to you,"

1093
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,800
"is known only by me or my God."

1094
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:35,800
"I want to keep walking
in your direction, beloved."

1095
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:42,520
"Let's fall in love with you."

1096
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:50,840
"Let's fall in love with you."

1097
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,520
"It was with God's will,

1098
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,800
"that I gave my heart to you."

1099
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,120
"Now I live every day of my life,"

1100
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:40,360
"only for you."

1101
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:44,640
"It was with God's will,

1102
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,880
"that I gave my heart to you."

1103
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,120
"Now I live every day of my life,"

1104
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,360
"only for you."

1105
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,640
"I am not one of those people,
who part ways..."

1106
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:06,440
"I am not one of those people,
who part ways..."

1107
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10,400
"midway somewhere."

1108
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,040
"Let's fall in love with you."

1109
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:25,760
"Let's fall in love with you."

1110
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:34,400
"Let's get shattered again."

1111
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:42,840
"Let's get shattered again."

1112
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:56,120
"Let's fall in love with you."

1113
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:05,040
"Let's fall in love with you."

1114
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,840
My son has come
to watch the Indian prisoners.

1115
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,080
He thinks they are very dangerous.

1116
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:54,480
Let him get over his fear.

1117
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,520
- Jailer.
- Yes, sir.

1118
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,320
Bring those prisoners out.

1119
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,480
Today is Eid.

1120
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,680
They deserve some festivities.

1121
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:11,080
My wish comes
to my lips as supplication of mine...

1122
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,800
O God!
May like the candle be the life of mine!

1123
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:57,520
My wish comes to my lips
as supplication of mine...

1124
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,520
Please, brother.

1125
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,720
I'll take this to the General.

1126
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,280
Hey, where are you going?

1127
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,080
The general said the prisoners
deserve some sweets--

1128
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,880
Mister. Mister.
They are our workers.

1129
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,320
- Happy Eid.
- Happy Eid.

1130
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,120
I am Muskaan.
Kurbaan Khan's daughter.

1131
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,600
- Subedaar.
- Sir.

1132
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,680
Go grab the sweets.

1133
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,120
Give me the sweets.

1134
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,640
Give me the sweets.

1135
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,400
Give me the sweets!

1136
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,760
Father...

1137
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,080
What happened?

1138
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,080
My father...
He isn't with them.

1139
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,080
He isn't.

1140
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,800
You bloody Indians don't deserve
any compassion.

1141
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,120
Put them all back in the cell.

1142
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,240
Take them away.

1143
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:33,400
Long Live India!

1144
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,640
They are just six.

1145
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,680
Where's the seventh one?

1146
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:41,160
Their boss...that Sardar,
the truck driver.

1147
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,040
He made trouble could of days ago.

1148
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,360
We've put him in solitary confinement.

1149
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,240
Do you have kerosene?

1150
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,840
Yes.

1151
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,080
When you get your chance...

1152
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,840
Where is this Asfaq?

1153
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,720
Father, it's Eid.
So he's staying with his uncle.

1154
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,360
I am so tired and sleepy,

1155
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,560
that I can't keep my eyes open.

1156
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,320
Time to open your eyes, Khan sir.

1157
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,560
Father?

1158
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,400
Father?

1159
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,640
Father?

1160
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,800
Uncle, you...?

1161
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:19,840
Where is my father?

1162
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,240
Where is my father?

1163
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,280
Father was never caught, son.

1164
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,560
Then where is he?

1165
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,800
Brother?

1166
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,800
Tara Ji!

1167
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,120
Thank God.

1168
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,920
The currents took me back to my country.

1169
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,720
The locals saved my life
and took me to a hospital.

1170
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,600
I had no papers or documents.

1171
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,560
And I was in a coma.

1172
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,280
So how could anyone inform
you about me?

1173
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,680
Jeetey...

1174
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,760
Jeetey...

1175
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,120
Jeetey?

1176
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,120
What happened to Jeetey?

1177
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,160
Pakistan...

1178
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,200
Pakistan?

1179
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,000
Why Pakistan?

1180
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,520
To look for you.

1181
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,920
And you let him go.

1182
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,000
- I tried...
- You let my son go!

1183
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,520
- I tried to stop him.
- You let him go to Pakistan!

1184
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,600
Tara.

1185
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,760
Don't get angry.

1186
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,600
What were you doing, aunty?

1187
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,320
- We tried to stop him.
- How could he go over there?

1188
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,600
He left without telling us.
He left a letter.

1189
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,920
What letter...

1190
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,040
We tried to stop him.

1191
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,840
Read this letter.

1192
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,440
How could he go to Pakistan?

1193
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,720
Mom, you say I shouldn't go
to Pakistan.

1194
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,600
Then what should I do?

1195
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,720
Take part in plays,
watch films, study in Chandigarh?

1196
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,400
What do I do when my father is missing?

1197
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,360
Shouldn't I go looking for him?

1198
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,400
Tara Singh's son.

1199
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,680
I am going.

1200
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,360
I will bring father back.

1201
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,400
Without him, there is no you,
no me and no family.

1202
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,480
Aunty...

1203
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,120
He...

1204
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,000
My son is there...

1205
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,240
I want my Jeetey back, Tara Ji.

1206
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,600
Tara... I want my Jeetey.

1207
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,040
I want my Jeetey back.

1208
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,360
He is definitely
in some kind of trouble.

1209
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,440
He hasn't written
to me for a long time.

1210
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,520
And...and that Hamid Iqbal...

1211
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,200
Jeetey

1212
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,080
Calm down.

1213
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,600
Don't worry.

1214
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,560
I will bring Jeetey back.

1215
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,360
I will bring our Jeetey back.

1216
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,680
No one can lay a finger on him.

1217
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:19,200
I will bring our Jeetey back.

1218
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,400
I will bring Jeetey back.

1219
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:33,720
"O Master of the two worlds,"

1220
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,120
"Hear my prayers."

1221
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,120
"O Master of the two worlds,"

1222
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,200
"Hear my wishes."

1223
01:30:54,400 --> 01:31:02,400
"My prayers for the apple of my eye."

1224
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:10,760
"Wherever he is,
always protect him."

1225
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:19,000
"Every moment,
keep him in Your sights."

1226
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:23,000
"Keep him in Your sights."

1227
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:27,040
"Keep him in Your sights."

1228
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:31,360
"Keep him in Your sights."

1229
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:35,400
"Just keep him in Your sights."

1230
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:04,600
"Don't let the scorching sun harm him."

1231
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:20,680
"Don't let the scorching sun harm him."

1232
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:28,840
"Don't let the rains make him ill."

1233
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:37,280
"Keep him covered with
Your own hands."

1234
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:45,440
"Keep him away from harm's way,"

1235
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,520
"bless him with Your grace."

1236
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,600
"Keep him in Your sights."

1237
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,680
"Keep him in Your sights."

1238
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:02,000
"Keep him in Your sights."

1239
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:10,320
"Just keep him in Your sights."

1240
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,160
"Keep him in Your sights."

1241
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:18,160
"Keep him in Your sights."

1242
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,520
"Keep him in Your sights."

1243
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,320
"Keep him in Your sights."

1244
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,120

01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,520
Crush India!

1268
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,880
If your wishes exceed your capacity,

1269
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,200
then you don't need enemies
to destroy you.

1270
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,480
Get lost.

1271
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,680
The next Friday prayers
will take place in Delhi!

1272
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,840
Crush India!

1273
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,760
The next Friday prayers
will take place in Delhi!

1274
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,400
Crush India!
Crush India!

1275
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,080
The next Friday prayers
will take place in Delhi!

1276
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,760
It was my bad luck that
I went to see my parents.

1277
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,800
If I hadn't,

1278
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,280
then your father wouldn't have taken
in a Hindu boy.

1279
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,120
He's worried about other's families,

1280
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,640
but not his own family.

1281
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,240
We don't have anything to eat.

1282
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,960
Now look at your father's condition.

1283
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,240
He's running from pillar to post.

1284
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,560
He's on the run.

1285
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,280
The police are chasing after him.

1286
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,320
We have nothing left to eat.

1287
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,760
No food.

1288
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,560
Are we going
to survive on these chillies?

1289
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,040
Your father is so stupid.

1290
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,920
Trying to save others family.

1291
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,560
What about his own family?

1292
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,040
- Keep this.
- You children are growing up too.

1293
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,280
Mom, Tara Singh gave us money.

1294
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,760
Money. Show me?

1295
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:25,440
Let me see. Great.

1296
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,360
But, mom, this is Indian money.

1297
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,720
Indian.

1298
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,360
Useless son of a useless father.

1299
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,200
What Indian?

1300
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,600
Do you know?

1301
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,280
Listen to me carefully.

1302
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,440
There is only one thing good
about India.

1303
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,760
Their money is worth double our money.

1304
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:44,960
Great.

1305
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,240
Go check there must
be more lying around there.

1306
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,760
Go check.

1307
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:53,400
Tara Singh,
you did one good thing before you left.

1308
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,520
Gave us some money.

1309
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,600
Wished you had given more.

1310
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,040
It's been so long since
I saw any money.

1311
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:18,000
The story remained untold...

1312
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,880
I found out from my shop,

1313
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,440
some stranger was looking for me.

1314
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,680
I knew it must be
you looking for Jeetey.

1315
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:32,760
Where is Jeetey?

1316
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:33,680
I will tell you.

1317
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,360
Cover your face before someone
recognises you.

1318
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,760
Come on.

1319
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:53,000
Tell me my friend, where did
my beloved where you spent the evening?

1320
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:57,280
everywhere.

1321
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,880
everywhere.

1322
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,280
Gullu.

1323
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,080
Gullu, look who is here.

1324
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:08,360
Gullu! It's Tara, Gullu.

1325
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,640
Tara. You are here, my buddy.

1326
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:14,840
You are here.
You are here, my friend.

1327
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,640
Save me, my friend.

1328
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,400
I lost my family, my home.

1329
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,080
The police beat me to a pulp.

1330
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,360
Look. Look at me.

1331
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,720
Gullu, you will get better.

1332
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,760
But, where is Jeetey?

1333
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,680
Your son Jeetey is a brave boy.

1334
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,040
There is no telling
how much he loves you.

1335
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,560
He faced several hurdles,

1336
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,680
took up several job,

1337
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,800
even cooked Biryani for customers,

1338
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,640
and finally made it
to jail looking for you.

1339
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,840
- Honestly.
- Jeetey?

1340
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,560
He entered the quagmire for you,

1341
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:59,840
but he couldn't get out of it.

1342
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,160
With the help of General Rani's cook,

1343
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,560
a cop told me--

1344
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:13,240
That night, when he entered the solitary
confinement cell to find you.

1345
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,080
You...

1346
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,480
This wretch helped you get in,
didn't she?

1347
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,800
How dare you hit me
in my own home?

1348
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:11,760
Your father must be yearning
for you just like this.

1349
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:15,880
Yes, he isn't dead yet.

1350
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,680
Tara Singh is alive.

1351
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,480
He will surely come to save you.

1352
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,880
It's time to offer our prayers, sir.

1353
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,200
Hamid Iqbal.

1354
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,040
A son, whose father is still alive,

1355
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,560
has nothing to worry about.

1356
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,400
You're going to pray, aren't you?

1357
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:58,360
Then better pray to Allah
my father doesn't land up here.

1358
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,000
Because if he does,

1359
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,680
and he sees me in this condition,

1360
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:15,160
then he will tear you into
so many pieces...

1361
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,000
That all of Pakistan
will not be able to count.

1362
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,040
I will kill Hamid Iqbal!

1363
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,240
Where is he?

1364
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,280
Tara...your temper is justified.

1365
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:48,120
But this is not the time
to lose control, Tara.

1366
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,560
We have to save Jeetey.

1367
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,320
Look at this poster.

1368
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,040
Take a look at it.

1369
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:59,680
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious and The Most Merciful one.

1370
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:05,600
You have all not gathered here willingly.

1371
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,080
In fact, you've been brought here
by Allah's will.

1372
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,880
Couple of years ago,

1373
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:14,200
what was initiated by a Hindu criminal,

1374
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:19,000
today Allah wants to put an end to it.

1375
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,360
Nara-e-takbir!

1376
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,240
Allah-o-Akbar!

1377
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,200
Nara-e-takbir!

1378
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,400
Allah-o-Akbar!

1379
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:31,040
Kill him. Kill him.
Kill him. Kill him.

1380
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,600
Kill him. Kill him.
Kill him. Kill him.

1381
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:32,480
Don't be fooled
by this boy's innocent face.

1382
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,880
This boy is an Indian spy.

1383
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:42,840
Not only did he use a fake passport
and visa to enter our country,

1384
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:48,040
he has even humiliated Islam
by posing as a fake Muslim.

1385
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:52,440
To fulfil his espionage intentions,

1386
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,560
just like his father,

1387
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:58,000
he misled an innocent girl
of Pakistan,

1388
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,560
made her fall in love with her,

1389
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,880
and tarnished her honour.

1390
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,240
Jeetey is innocent.

1391
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,480
He didn't lay a finger on me.

1392
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,800
He has committed no crime.

1393
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,200
Jeetey is not a spy.

1394
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,000
Forgive him. Forgive him.

1395
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,840
Muskaan is right, sir.

1396
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:25,480
- Mukhtair!
- Uncle--

1397
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,600
Mukhtair!

1398
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,680
You are lucky.

1399
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,160
Allah himself has bestowed you,

1400
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,120
with the opportunity
to raise the flag of Ghazwa-e-Hind.

1401
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:55,520
General sir, please forgive Jeetey.

1402
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,680
Forgive him.

1403
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:59,680
Sign this.

1404
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,080
General...

1405
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,560
Sign it, woman.

1406
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:11,280
Otherwise...

1407
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:28,240
Muskaan, my child,
is this your statement?

1408
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:32,240
Every word written here is true,
isn't it?

1409
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,080
This infidel Indian has tarnished
your honour.

1410
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,040
Tell them.

1411
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:45,160
Tell everyone...
that he tarnish your honour.

1412
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:48,600
Is this your signature?

1413
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:54,880
And did anyone force you to sign this?

1414
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:05,360
Are these your signatures?

1415
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,920
Yes.

1416
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,880
Could there be a sin bigger than this,

1417
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,880
in Islam's view?

1418
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,000
Our scholars have stated

1419
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,720
one day...
Ghazwa-e-Hind will become a reality.

1420
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,600
So be it.

1421
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,760
Every Hindu will convert to Muslim.

1422
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,880
So be it.

1423
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:35,720
These Hindus want to mislead
our innocent daughters.

1424
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,600
Tarnish their honour.

1425
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:40,720
Convert them.

1426
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,080
Allah-o-Akbar!
Allah-o-Akbar!

1427
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,120
Jeetey!

1428
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:00,480
Be patient.

1429
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,640
This infidel will be punished.

1430
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,360
Tie him to the mouth of the cannon.

1431
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,360
And let the world
watch justice of Sheriyat.

1432
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:17,480
Great. You call this justice.

1433
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:23,680
My mother has narrated Koran
to me more times then you have read it.

1434
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,000
She has explained it to me.

1435
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:30,920
And the Koran says the dying person
is asked for his final wish.

1436
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,560
After the heinous crime
you committed,

1437
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:37,760
you've lost your right
to a final wish, boy.

1438
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,360
But the Pakistani law is merciful.

1439
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,640
Tell me...

1440
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,640
What is your last wish?

1441
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:58,000
Son would like to meet his father.

1442
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,600
Tara Singh.
You arrived at the right occasion.

1443
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,040
Son being murdered
in front of his father.

1444
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,080
What a sight!

1445
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,360
You killed 40 of my men.

1446
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,800
Finally, I will be at peace.

1447
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,320
General.

1448
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:26,120
Let me son go.

1449
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,640
He is innocent.

1450
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,720
Your grudge is with me.

1451
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,600
I am right here.

1452
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:35,840
I've a grudge with every Indian.

1453
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:40,520
You are done torturing
my Muslim brothers in India.

1454
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,800
Now...we will get them freedom.

1455
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,800
Freedom from whom?

1456
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,440
India belongs to Muslims.

1457
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,840
India belongs
to Christians, Sikhs, Hindus.

1458
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,000
It belongs to every Indian.

1459
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:04,040
Together they fought
for our independence.

1460
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,080
They made several sacrifices.

1461
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:10,120
I see...then what about East Pakistan,

1462
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,920
where you misled Bengali Pakistanis,

1463
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,640
and formed the Mukti Bahini Army?

1464
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,880
What about that?

1465
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,880
We did not form any army.

1466
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,720
They are victims of your torture.

1467
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:29,680
Your soldiers killed
three million Bengali Muslims.

1468
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,960
They tortured their woman.

1469
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,240
No! It's a lie.

1470
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:40,400
Then what about
the 10 million refugees in India?

1471
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:45,120
It was staged by your people
to show to the world.

1472
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,240
Stop lying, General.

1473
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:51,320
Stop these political games.

1474
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,680
Stop playing God to Muslims.

1475
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:59,480
If the people are given a chance,
to resettle in India.

1476
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:03,520
Then half of Pakistan will be empty.

1477
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:09,040
Your politics will make you a pauper.

1478
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,800
You will be begging on the streets,

1479
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,680
and no one will give you any alms.

1480
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,720
Enough of this rubbish.

1481
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,000
Tie father and son
to the cannon's mouth.

1482
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:25,720
Let's see what he uproots today!

1483
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,160
Catch him.

1484
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:06,880
Hamid!

1485
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,640
Tara Singh.

1486
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:16,360
In order to deliver the devout,

1487
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:18,240
Attack.

1488
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:23,480
And to eradicate the heretical,

1489
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:30,360
As well as to reestablish
the essence of dharma,

1490
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:34,880
I Myself appear millennium
after millennium.

1491
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,880
Jeetey.

1492
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:31,400
Jeetey.

1493
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:34,240
Father.

1494
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:42,200
Jeetey.

1495
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,640
Jeetey.

1496
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Father.

1497
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:01,320
Father.

1498
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:12,040
Jeetey! Jeetey! Jeetey!

1499
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,560
Jeetey is over here.

1500
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,400
Tara Singh, where are you?

1501
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:26,240
Jeetey is over here, with me.

1502
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,600
Tara Singh, you coward,
show yourself!

1503
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,040
Let my son go, please.

1504
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,200
Please, please.

1505
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,440
Hamid!

1506
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:58,480
Hamid, save my son, please.

1507
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,320
Drop the guns.

1508
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:00,800
Please. Shoaib.

1509
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,280
Shoaib...Shoaib.

1510
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,160
Save Shoaib, please.

1511
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:06,800
My baby... my baby.

1512
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,040
Shoaib...

1513
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,680
Shattered to bits, aren't you?

1514
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,480
And my father didn't even lay
a finger on you.

1515
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:45,000
Shoaib!

1516
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:47,520
- Shoaib, my child!
- Shoaib, my baby!

1517
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:29,320
Hands don't lie

1518
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:33,480
Unflinching shock closing in

1519
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:39,800
You and I feverishly tipping high

1520
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:43,520
Toes trotting jazz got us

1521
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:46,560
Hamid, you'remaking history.

1522
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:48,720
Rewritten it, rather.

1523
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:52,120
Amazing comments
are being said for you.

1524
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:54,160
General sir. Wait up.

1525
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,360
Amazing.

1526
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,480
Hold this.

1527
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:00,360
One thing about Tara Singh...

1528
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,800
He seems like a glorious man.

1529
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:10,440
Catch him for my sake.

1530
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,640
You just start anywhere, Rani.

1531
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,160
That's why I am a fan of you.

1532
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,200
And that stupid made a fool of you.

1533
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,640
And he himself became a hero.

1534
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,040
You bloody idiot.

1535
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,960
He just caught your son,

1536
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,280
and you started shitting
in your pants.

1537
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,640
Look at this newspaper.
Look at this newspaper.

1538
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,520
- Hello, Mr. Khan.
- Hello.

1539
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,760
Look at this newspaper.

1540
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:36,000
Come here, take a look,

1541
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:39,120
at this cartoon in Indian newspapers.

1542
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:41,360
Read it out, Noor.

1543
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,440
It says,
"He's the son-in-law of Pakistan."

1544
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,160
"Welcome him, anoint him."

1545
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:52,400
"Otherwise, this time
he will take Lahore in dowry."

1546
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:54,520
Bloody shit.

1547
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,200
You are very naughty, Noor.

1548
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:57,640
- Come here.
- Rani.

1549
01:58:57,880 --> 01:59:00,400
You embarrassed us
in front of the enemy.

1550
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:03,080
I told you there is no need
for drama now.

1551
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:04,480
This is not the right time.

1552
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,040
We'll do it after the war.

1553
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,560
Tara won't go anywhere,

1554
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:11,280
until we have his son behind bars.

1555
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,080
You bloody tried to convince me...

1556
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:17,040
You convinced me...
that the morale of my boys will go up.

1557
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,960
Maulanas are doing let them do it.

1558
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,880
You have 72 hours.

1559
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,320
Only until Friday.

1560
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,440
If he crosses the Pakistan border,

1561
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,120
then your fate will be just like
Ashraf Ali's.

1562
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:29,320
Understand?

1563
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,360
Sadar sir.

1564
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,600
I've endured a lot of humiliation
during the partition.

1565
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,520
And every time I've emerged stronger.

1566
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:44,200
I will do so this time as well.

1567
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:46,280
Thank you very much, sir.

1568
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,560
Sir, we've sealed the Lahore border.

1569
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:58,640
The father and son duo
can never get out of Lahore.

1570
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:08,880
I breathed a sigh of relief
when I read the newspaper.

1571
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,920
Are you okay, Tara ji?

1572
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,800
Don't worry, Madam ji.

1573
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:15,600
We are both absolutely fine.

1574
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:20,640
Jeetey. Where is Jeetey?

1575
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,120
Here, talk to your son.

1576
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,520
- Hello, mom?
- Jeetey.

1577
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:29,320
Mom...

1578
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:31,920
how are you?

1579
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:35,400
It's been so long since
I heard your voice.

1580
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:36,520
Don't cry, mom.

1581
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,040
Don't cry.

1582
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,680
You made your son emotional.

1583
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,600
Stop crying.

1584
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:57,400
And tell the colonel,

1585
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,640
that Valli bhai helped us a great deal.

1586
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:01,840
He also told us a way
to get out of here.

1587
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:04,640
We'll take part
in the procession tomorrow,

1588
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:05,880
and cross the border.

1589
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:06,920
Not possible.

1590
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,600
It's not possible
to cross the border, my friend.

1591
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:10,000
Looking at the current situation,

1592
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:11,600
the government has cancelled
the procession.

1593
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,920
Police and the army
have surrounded us from all sides.

1594
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:16,200
There is no way out of here.

1595
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:18,880
There is a way.

1596
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,280
Surrender.

1597
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:35,160
Catch him.

1598
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,240
Catch them. Go.

1599
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,200
Let's go, Jeetey!

1600
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:24,840
Wait here, son.

1601
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:45,240
Weapons cannot shred the soul,

1602
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:49,640
Nor can fire burn it,

1603
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:58,160
Water cannot wet it,

1604
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:02,880
Nor can the win dry it.

1605
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,000
Father, give me your hand.

1606
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:17,480
Fire!

1607
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,320
Jeetey.

1608
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:51,520
Jeetey.

1609
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,680
Jeetey.

1610
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:04,520
Jeetey.

1611
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:11,640
Jeetey.

1612
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:14,360
This is Radio Pakistan.

1613
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:17,320
In breaking news,

1614
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,760
Pakistani forces have severely injured,

1615
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,440
Tara Singh and his son Jeetey

1616
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:25,520
and separated them from each other.

1617
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:30,000
They are looking everywhere
for these two.

1618
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:31,760
More lives...

1619
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:33,560
It's also been announced,

1620
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:34,920
if anyone helps them,

1621
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:38,240
then they will be deemed a traitor,

1622
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:41,720
and punished severely.

1623
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:46,040
General Hamid Iqbal has made big claims,

1624
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:49,760
saying soon father
and son will be in his custody.

1625
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:51,680
and punish them brutally,

1626
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,520
which will make India shiver.

1627
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,480
Sir. Yes, sir.

1628
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:23,720
We heard a rumour about Tara Singh.

1629
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,560
Someone spotted him
in the Punjab University area, sir.

1630
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,680
Yes, sir.

1631
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:34,000
Sir, where else can they go
but straight to hell?

1632
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:49,400
Punjab University.

1633
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:54,080
Do you want to meet your father?

1634
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:57,000
Police. Police...

1635
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,000
Shut up.

1636
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:53,400
There is still time
for the 72-hour deadline.

1637
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:55,680
We have already
got the location of his son.

1638
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:57,200
And, as for Tara Singh--

1639
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:04,440
Hey...

1640
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,120
Where is my son?

1641
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,240
Muslimpura.

1642
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,800
All stations.

1643
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:41,240
Get all the Maulanas' men activated.

1644
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:44,000
Over and out.

1645
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:14,240
- Where is that non believer?
- That way!

1646
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:15,560
Let's go.

1647
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:08,360
Come on.

1648
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:38,560
Come out.

1649
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,360
I've closed all the doors.

1650
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:48,720
Eat some food.
You must be hungry.

1651
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:50,920
Why this favour?

1652
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:53,320
I am an Indian.

1653
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:57,240
- And I--
- Who came from India to look for his father.

1654
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:00,480
Newspapers have found their
"breaking news",

1655
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:02,520
and people have found
their daily dose of drama.

1656
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:05,120
Come on.

1657
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,400
Don't think too much.

1658
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:24,440
Okay...do one thing.

1659
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:27,160
When you go back to India,

1660
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:31,240
then help a helpless Pakistani.

1661
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,720
You'll be surprised at
how peaceful you will feel.

1662
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:39,040
Come on, eat it.

1663
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:50,800
Hmm.

1664
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:55,320
My father must be hungry too.

1665
02:13:58,240 --> 02:13:59,600
I'll take these.

1666
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:02,400
- I will eat with him.
- But...

1667
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:05,040
- I'll leave.
- Take more...

1668
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:06,480
Listen, son.

1669
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:09,600
No...it's better I leave
in this darkness.

1670
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:13,200
I don't want anything bad
to happen to my aunt.

1671
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:16,560
Aunt?

1672
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:18,520
This is my mom's home.

1673
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:22,080
Pakistan.

1674
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:29,160
Where else would I have an aunt?

1675
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:48,440
The police treated
Tara's son unfairly.

1676
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:52,360
They beat him to an inch of his life.

1677
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:54,480
Jeetey.

1678
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:01,320
But the son's emotion
for his father is amazing.

1679
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,840
Gives you a strange courage.

1680
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:06,440
He escaped from police custody.

1681
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:08,640
To find his father.

1682
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:11,400
He's lost so much blood,

1683
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:14,120
whether anyone finds him or not,

1684
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,120
scavengers will definitely find him.

1685
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:19,560
Poor guy will become food
for scavengers.

1686
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:25,160
Jeetey.

1687
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:48,680
God. Protect Jeetey from harm.

1688
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,720
Protect him.

1689
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,280
Please, God.

1690
02:16:56,520 --> 02:17:01,200
God. Protect Jeetey from harm.

1691
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:44,760
"Come home O traveller,"

1692
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:50,520
"without you I am incomplete."

1693
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:58,000
"Come home O traveller,"

1694
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:03,800
"without you I am incomplete."

1695
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:11,080
"Come home O traveller,"

1696
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:16,480
"without you I am incomplete."

1697
02:18:48,360 --> 02:18:54,720
"Our love story is filled
with so much bane."

1698
02:18:54,880 --> 02:19:01,400
"Our love story is filled
with so much bane."

1699
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:08,080
"Like the seven seas dwell
in our eyes."

1700
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:14,480
"When my heart and I..."

1701
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:21,160
"When my heart
and I talk about you."

1702
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:26,760
"The rains pour
in before the monsoon arrives."

1703
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:30,040
"Come home O traveller,"

1704
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:33,320
"without you I am incomplete."

1705
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:36,600
"Take me home O traveller,"

1706
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:40,480
"without you I am incomplete."

1707
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:44,200
"Take me home O traveller,"

1708
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:47,480
"without you I am incomplete."

1709
02:19:47,560 --> 02:19:50,760
"Come home O traveller,"

1710
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:54,040
"without you I am incomplete."

1711
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:57,320
"Come home O traveller,"

1712
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:00,640
"without you I am incomplete."

1713
02:20:02,320 --> 02:20:04,720
This is Sultan bhai.
From Muslimpura.

1714
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:07,560
He is a park ranger.

1715
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:09,440
He helped us find you.

1716
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:12,280
Don't worry.

1717
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:14,800
We'll get you across before dawn.

1718
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:16,440
There is a bridge close
to the border.

1719
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:19,200
Smugglers have built
a tunnel under it.

1720
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,000
That's how they smuggle goods
in and out.

1721
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:24,520
Kurban Khan.

1722
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:28,520
You helped my son.

1723
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:34,080
And your entire family had
to pay the price.

1724
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:35,240
And yet, you are...

1725
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:36,720
That's not true, Tara Singh.

1726
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:40,880
Helping you cross is
a good deed for us.

1727
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:43,440
That is why Ranger sir
is helping you too.

1728
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:46,840
There is no danger.

1729
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:51,120
After we help you,
we'll leave for Balochistan.

1730
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Tara...

1731
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:58,280
I have a request.

1732
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:06,400
Return my daughter's happiness to her.

1733
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:11,120
Your daughter is like my daughter.

1734
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:16,320
Thank you.

1735
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,160
She will be alright.

1736
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:48,720
Father...

1737
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:58,200
Father, please don't send me away.

1738
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:07,040
This is where
I was born and raised.

1739
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:16,000
How do I leave you
and start afresh?

1740
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:25,000
I cannot hold my tears back,
I just cannot.

1741
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:36,360
I cannot hold my tears back,
I just cannot.

1742
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:45,680
I cannot hold my tears back,
I just cannot.

1743
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:49,400
My child...please, don't cry.

1744
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:24,800
The infidels escaped.

1745
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,320
There is a bridge close
to the border.

1746
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:42,000
Tara Singh.

1747
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:45,000
Returning to your motherland?

1748
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,120
Take this gift along.

1749
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:49,280
Brother!

1750
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:51,360
Farid!

1751
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:54,880
Farid!

1752
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:56,680
What do you say, Tara Singh?

1753
02:23:57,080 --> 02:24:00,200
I've not one, not two,

1754
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:02,000
but several gifts for you.

1755
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:06,080
Your Indian soldiers
and your son's in-laws too.

1756
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:12,320
Tara Singh,
which gift should I send next?

1757
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,480
Stop.

1758
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,040
Father.

1759
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,800
What's the plan now, Tara Singh?

1760
02:25:03,560 --> 02:25:04,560
What now, huh?

1761
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:06,320
How will you escape now?

1762
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:09,240
We don't even have my son here
for you to threaten.

1763
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,680
How are you going
to take out my soldiers now, huh?

1764
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:17,360
You took them down before, remember?

1765
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:24,040
And what about you?

1766
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:27,120
"A father's always got his son's back."

1767
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:30,360
You spat on my face, didn't you?

1768
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:32,840
I dare you to try it again.

1769
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:36,120
Go on, do it,
now that your father's here too.

1770
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:38,480
Go on!

1771
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,600
Jeetey!

1772
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:52,640
We desire 'Gazwa-E-Hind',

1773
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:57,000
and you desire to convert
our daughters instead?

1774
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:01,280
You want to step on my land,
my Pakistan,

1775
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:03,800
and start chanting "Long Live India"?

1776
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:07,000
You did that, didn't you?

1777
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:09,240
Long Live India!

1778
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:12,200
Subedaar, turn on the camera.

1779
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:23,200
Now you're going to chant,
"India be damned."

1780
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:38,480
Say it, Tara Singh -

1781
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:45,040
India be damned.

1782
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:52,000
Say it.

1783
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:55,120
SAY IT!

1784
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:57,800
My India was worth praising,

1785
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:01,120
is worth praising,

1786
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:04,440
and is always going be worth praising!

1787
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:07,280
Hey!

1788
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:13,600
I'll say it.

1789
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:31,200
I will say it.

1790
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:34,720
But how will it matter if I say it?

1791
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:39,160
Even if I say those words,

1792
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:42,640
it won't diminish the worthiness of
my country.

1793
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:49,360
Our tricolor flies high in the sky
and will keep on doing so.

1794
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:55,160
Even if every Pakistani here says
"India be damned,"

1795
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:58,400
their voices won't reach the border.

1796
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:04,920
But if every Indian says,
"Long Live India,"

1797
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:08,680
the sound of it will tear all
of you apart.

1798
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:23,640
Long Live India!

1799
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:28,120
"O' my Motherland, I bow to thee!"

1800
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:30,560
"O' my Motherland, I bow to thee!"

1801
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:33,640
Long Live India!

1802
02:28:33,720 --> 02:28:37,360
"O' my Motherland, I bow to thee!"

1803
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:42,320
Long Live India!

1804
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:46,240
"O' my Motherland, I bow to thee!"

1805
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,560
Long Live India!

1806
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:18,960
- "O' my Motherland, I bow to thee!"
- Tara Singh!

1807
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:30,280
"O' my Motherland, I bow to thee!"

1808
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:34,040
Hold up. Nobody shoot.

1809
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:35,200
He's got the General.

1810
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:36,360
Catch him alive.

1811
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:37,280
Go.

1812
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:52,000
Jeetey!

1813
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:58,640
"He is complete, he is summit,
he is pot of fire"

1814
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:08,000
"He can cause uproar,
he is the punishment for justice"

1815
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:17,280
"In the flow of emotions,
he is like a summit of a mountain"

1816
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:19,640
- Hurry up, Tara Singh.
- Jeetey!

1817
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:25,120
"The one who destroys the evil,
he is with the truth"

1818
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,680
Come on, come on.

1819
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:31,560
No!

1820
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:47,120
Surround them!
They shouldn't escape!

1821
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:49,480
Load! Ready, set, fire!

1822
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:56,440
Fire!

1823
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:27,080
Load! Move forward, you buggers!

1824
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,440
Get up and move!
Go, open fire!

1825
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:41,280
'H' 'E' Turret lock!

1826
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:44,320
- Sir!
- Delta One, move right!

1827
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:45,760
Sir, the turret is locked.

1828
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:48,040
Push the turret manually
towards the target.

1829
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:55,800
Move! Move!

1830
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:07,760
- Hit! - Move forward!
- Yes, sir!

1831
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:20,000
More tanks!

1832
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:24,600
Major, look there!

1833
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:29,320
Move forward!

1834
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:30,640
Yes, sir!

1835
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:50,040
Crush them!

1836
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:53,280
Block them on both sides!

1837
02:33:53,360 --> 02:33:54,480
Charge!

1838
02:33:54,560 --> 02:33:55,920
Block them on both sides!

1839
02:33:58,280 --> 02:33:59,040
Move!

1840
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:01,120
God help me!

1841
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,120
Jeetey!

1842
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:10,720
Father!

1843
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:16,320
Father!

1844
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:35,080
Bloody infidels!

1845
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:38,760
Get down!

1846
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:53,000
Where will escape now, huh?

1847
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:54,520
Get down.

1848
02:34:58,720 --> 02:34:59,720
Tara Singh!

1849
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:20,600
Glory to India!

1850
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:23,080
Glory to India!

1851
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:25,760
Glory to India!

1852
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:28,400
Glory to India!

1853
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:31,000
Glory to India!

1854
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:34,320
Glory to India!

1855
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:36,720
Glory to India!

1856
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:39,680
Glory to India!

1857
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:11,040
What is this nonsense, Colonel?

1858
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:12,360
Look at my ranks.

1859
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:14,640
I'm the General of the Pakistan army.

1860
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,200
Don't you know the Geneva Convention,
damn it?

1861
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:18,480
I'm in India.

1862
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,720
I'm a POW.

1863
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:21,080
Prisoner of war.

1864
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:23,880
Arrest me.

1865
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,560
Did you follow the Geneva Convention
at Ram Tekdi?

1866
02:36:27,440 --> 02:36:28,520
Did you?

1867
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:29,920
Look at my men.

1868
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,360
Look at their condition.

1869
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:34,200
You're lucky we didn't start a war yet,

1870
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:38,120
or we would've met not here,
but in Lahore.

1871
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:41,840
And there, General,

1872
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:46,600
your neck would've been
in Colonel Rawant's hands.

1873
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:51,120
But as of today,
the war hasn't even started yet.

1874
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:55,240
There is no war diary,
no arrest memo.

1875
02:36:55,320 --> 02:36:56,680
In fact, officially,

1876
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:59,240
we aren't even here.

1877
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:03,760
So you're playing games?

1878
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:06,200
Now I am going to look the other way,

1879
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:09,600
and you and Tara Singh
can settle your scores.

1880
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:50,440
No, Tara Singh.

1881
02:37:51,560 --> 02:37:53,000
I have a family.

1882
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:57,320
I have a little kid.

1883
02:37:57,880 --> 02:37:59,480
Please, please.

1884
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:04,360
And what about the families you killed,
including the kids?

1885
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:07,280
You guys killed my family
too during the partition!

1886
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:10,560
Countless families lost loved
ones during the partition.

1887
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:15,680
It was a tragic incident
that we've already put behind us.

1888
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:18,640
But you're exploiting that incident.

1889
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:21,000
You are using it as an excuse,

1890
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:25,840
along with your religion,
to behead people.

1891
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:42,840
She's the Quran-e-Sharif.

1892
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,600
And he's the Bhagavad-Gita.

1893
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:56,560
Now pick one.

1894
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:16,880
What's the difference between the two?

1895
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:19,040
The world was formed from one light.

1896
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:23,360
Wasn't that what Baba Nanak
also preached?

1897
02:39:23,440 --> 02:39:26,640
If you had followed
Baba Nanak's teachings,

1898
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:30,600
you would have embraced
people instead of beheading them.

1899
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:36,600
Tell me, you want to live or die?

1900
02:39:45,160 --> 02:39:46,360
Quran?

1901
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:50,880
Or Gita?

1902
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:25,320
Gita.

1903
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:26,920
Gita.

1904
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:27,920
Gita.

1905
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:29,520
Gita.

1906
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:38,520
Couldn't you have embraced both of them?

1907
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:41,360
What kind of person are you?

1908
02:40:42,880 --> 02:40:45,680
If you had followed
the path set by your Lord,

1909
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:48,240
you would not have spoken
about 'Gazwa-E-Hind'.

1910
02:40:49,240 --> 02:40:51,480
You would have instead spoken
about loving India.

1911
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:55,680
And this world would
be like heaven then.

1912
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:16,120
Tara Singh!

1913
02:41:16,360 --> 02:41:18,040
Fire!

1914
02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:56,680
I'm so proud of you, Tara Singh Ji.

1915
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:04,240
You wanted your son
to be a soldier like me, right?

1916
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:08,520
I think he's ready to join the army.

1917
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,440
What do you say?

1918
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:12,800
Yes, sir.

1919
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:16,880
Yes, sir.

1920
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:18,440
Yes, sir.

1921
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:21,560
"The swings are out again,"

1922
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:25,160
"and the fruits have ripened."

1923
02:42:25,240 --> 02:42:28,200
"The swings are out again,"

1924
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:31,840
"and the fruits have ripened."

1925
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:37,120
"Life is short, nights are too long."

1926
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:40,400
"Come home O traveller,"

1927
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:43,720
"without you I am incomplete."

1928
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:47,040
"Come home O traveller,"

1929
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:50,360
"without you I am incomplete."

1930
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:03,600
"Life is short, nights are too long."

1931
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:06,880
"Come home O traveller,"

1932
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:10,240
"without you I am incomplete."

1933
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:13,480
"Come home O traveller,"

1934
02:43:13,560 --> 02:43:16,840
"without you I am incomplete."

1935
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:40,040
- "Come home O traveller,"

1936
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:43,320
"without you I am incomplete."

1937
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:53,280
"Come home O traveller,"

1938
02:43:53,360 --> 02:43:56,560
"without you I am incomplete."

1939
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:59,880
"Come home O traveller,"

1940
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,240
"without you I am incomplete."

1941
02:44:03,320 --> 02:44:06,560
"Come home O traveller,"

1942
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:09,840
"without you I am incomplete."

1943
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:13,200
"Come home O traveller,"

1944
02:44:13,280 --> 02:44:16,480
"without you I am incomplete."

1945
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:19,760
"Come home O traveller,"

1946
02:44:19,880 --> 02:44:23,080
"without you I am incomplete."

1947
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:26,400
"Come home O traveller,"

1948
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:29,720
"without you I am incomplete."

1949
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:33,080
"Come home O traveller,"

1950
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:36,640
"without you I am incomplete."
