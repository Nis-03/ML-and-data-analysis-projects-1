1
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,217
Stop, Yash. Stop.

2
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:54,331
Pranab-da's dog bit Mr Vajpayee.

3
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:58,533
Our Pranab-da? Pranab Mukherjee?

4
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,564
A dog bit him on his walk.

5
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:02,989
Oh no! Now that's 14 injections.

6
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,411
That's not written here.

7
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,328
He has no choice. What is it?

8
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,707
- There's eggplant on the pen.
- So?

9
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,849
I told you not to come
at lunchtime.

10
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:14,959
Eggplant! It's not poison, is it?

11
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:16,477
Strange fellow.

12
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:19,420
- Who eats eggplant every day?
- Well, I do.

13
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,001
Every day?

14
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,400
I like it.

15
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,794
Careful.

16
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:25,978
What's this?

17
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,580
- Well?
- An invitation.

18
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,537
- To what?
- The World Cup.

19
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,981
Really?

20
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,975
The dacoit Phoolan Devi
is surrendering.

21
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,878
- I hear she's beautiful.
- There's no photo.

22
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:42,301
Look! The launch of the Maruti car.

23
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:53,899
Kapil Dev, Mohinder Amarnath,

24
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,868
Madan Lal, Kirti Azad,
Sunil Valson.

25
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:00,770
Why are you taking their
bags with you, Mr Singh?

26
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:04,648
Because they're already in England,
playing County Cricket.

27
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:05,737
Congrats.

28
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,855
You mean they've replaced Gavaskar
with this guy as captain?

29
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:08,936
Hey!

30
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,370
- Can he do it?
- Sure, he can.

31
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:11,828
That also in England?

32
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:13,713
He can't even speak
English properly.

33
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:17,067
But he plays cricket well.

34
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:18,249
So what?

35
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,410
When are you back, Mr Singh?

36
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,580
When there are no more
matches for us to play.

37
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,675
The East Africans aren't playing.
So, who will you defeat?

38
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:30,611
The Cricket Board isn't even
hosting a farewell party.

39
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:33,355
Good luck!
Take care. See you.

40
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:35,325
We'll celebrate when we're back.

41
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:36,991
Celebrate what?

42
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,618
Good luck, Mr Singh.

43
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:43,554
All the best.

44
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:19,614
Well bowled, Kaps!

45
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:23,096
Mr Dev, your call to India
is connected, sir.

46
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:26,737
Hello, Romi.

47
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:31,296
Romi's out right now, Kuku.
Talk to me instead.

48
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:33,781
What will be happening here?

49
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:36,825
Half the kids are drinking milk.
The others are playing cricket.

50
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:40,600
You should play cricket all day
and drink gallons of milk.

51
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,756
A call from London?
And you didn't tell me?

52
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:46,556
Pinky, Happi, Guddo! Come,
a call from London.

53
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,969
And you...Meshi!
Call Kake too.

54
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,344
Come here!

55
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:52,527
Give me the phone.

56
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,401
Hello, Kuku!

57
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:56,512
Yes, Mama.

58
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:59,377
- Are you wearing your sweater?
- <i>Yes, Mama. I will.</i>

59
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:02,978
Son, win the Cup and come home.

60
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:06,366
Yes, Mama.

61
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:07,862
Tell me.

62
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,075
Hello.

63
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:10,449
Hello.

64
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:11,357
Hello.

65
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:12,853
Hello.

66
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,436
The line's cut.

67
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,230
I didn't get a chance to talk.

68
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:27,376
Kaps, catch!

69
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,381
Impossible!

70
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,837
If Kapil catches it, I'll do
anything he wants me to.

71
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:38,845
- Sorry, sorry. That was tough.
- Jimmy said,

72
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:42,049
if you catch it, you can ask
for anything.

73
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:45,646
I'll ask him to teach me English
before the World Cup starts.

74
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:49,191
Asking for my life
would be easier!

75
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,316
That reminds me.
Did you talk to Lala-ji today?

76
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,755
- I'll do it now. Hold this.
- Give him my regards.

77
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,078
He isn't scared of the world's
fastest bowlers,

78
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,573
but trembles when he hears
Lala-ji's name.

79
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:05,041
Lala-ji, they're not playing
proper cricket.

80
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:07,733
60 overs. Start in the morning
finish in the evening.

81
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:10,904
Carry on like this and the game
will be reduced to 10 or 20 overs.

82
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:13,185
Sharma-ji, what nonsense!

83
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:16,135
- Mr Jimmy is on the line.
- He'll live a hundred years.

84
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,710
Hello, Jimmy, my son.
How are you?

85
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:23,614
<i>I'm sending you two bottles
of pickle with Yash.</i>

86
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:27,482
Mr Singh, why do you have
so many bottles of pickle?

87
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,919
Opening a store in London?

88
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,172
The food's so bland there.

89
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:35,957
Can't eat without pickles.

90
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:39,523
Well, sir, you'll have to pay
excess baggage.

91
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:41,764
Or leave some behind.

92
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,757
Give me a receipt.

93
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:48,547
Maan, we're vegetarians.

94
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,585
How will we eat there?

95
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:53,007
That's 5800-rupees.

96
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,387
But, sir, I don't have
that much on me.

97
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:57,332
Here.

98
00:07:57,452 --> 00:08:00,321
Ask your office to pay
the money tomorrow.

99
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,033
Yes.

100
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:05,434
Mr Singh! Will you do me a favour?

101
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,300
- Can you get me an autograph?
- You can ask them now.

102
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,104
No, no.

103
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:11,664
I mean Viv Richards.

104
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:13,983
Please try.

105
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:15,985
Don't forget.

106
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,735
Thank you very much.

107
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:23,004
I'll get you Queen Elizabeth's
autograph too. You fool!

108
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:25,720
Sunil Gavaskar.

109
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:30,055
Syed Kirmani.

110
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:33,885
Yashpal Sharma.

111
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,681
Krishnamachari Srikkanth.

112
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:41,366
Dilip Vengsarkar.

113
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,358
Roger Binny.

114
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:47,042
Balwinder Singh Sandhu.

115
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,956
Sandeep Patil.

116
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,877
Ravi Shastri.

117
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:56,186
PR Man Singh.

118
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,297
Where's our team bus?

119
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,367
No, no. No bus here
for Indian team.

120
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:46,994
You mean on flight only?
When?

121
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,374
Rascal! You just got engaged.

122
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:53,504
Not for you.

123
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,510
The bus is here.

124
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,423
- Tell me more.
- Let's get on the bus.

125
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:05,308
- Did something happen?
- None of your business.

126
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,433
Tell me!

127
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:10,051
Patla told the airhostess
on our flight:

128
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,832
"Hi, I'm Sandeep Patil.

129
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:13,055
Sandy to you."

130
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:15,282
Then Yashpal says,

131
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:17,284
"Hi, I'm Yash to you."

132
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:20,559
The rascal added if India wins
the World Cup,

133
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:22,669
he'll eat this newspaper.

134
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:26,963
Ballu was next. And you know
what he said?

135
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:30,613
He says to her:
"Hi, I'm Balwinder Singh Sandhu."

136
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:32,755
"Balls to you!"

137
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:35,151
Listen, everyone.

138
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:37,811
Listen, everyone.

139
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:44,076
Today for the vegetarians, there's
only bread, butter and salad.

140
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:46,653
Why look at me, Cheeka?

141
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,123
- We'll sort it out tomorrow.
- Listen, soldiers!

142
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:52,414
Welcome to London!

143
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:58,028
We must play four warm-up matches
before the tournament.

144
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:00,424
Let's show them what
we're made of.

145
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:09,075
<i>This moment is frozen in time</i>

146
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,125
<i>A glorious dream is a few steps away</i>

147
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,454
- What?
- South Indian.

148
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,742
What's this rubbish you're eating?
Five, ten, fifteen.

149
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:43,945
<i>Today belongs to you.</i>

150
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:49,678
Go outside.

151
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,035
Hello, Simran.

152
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:55,649
- Did you get there safely?
- Yes, I'm in London.

153
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:58,533
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

154
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,344
The airhostess served us lunch.
Very nice.

155
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,313
"Nice?" The airhostess?

156
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,912
No, the food was nice.

157
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:08,008
<i>Cross the bumpy roads ahead</i>

158
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,705
Good ball, Kaps.

159
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,163
What a shot! It's a boundary, bro.

160
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,927
Inswinger.

161
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,013
Easy, Cheeka.
It's only net practice.

162
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,516
When I hit, I hit hard.

163
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,219
I don't know how to play defence.

164
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,938
I know only hitting.
Go, go bowl.

165
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,686
Kapil, I'll end up hitting his head.

166
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:33,595
He doesn't know defence.

167
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:36,494
Mr Man Singh, how may I help you?

168
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,211
This pass says entry to all
stadiums except Lord's.

169
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,881
But India doesn't have any game
at Lord's.

170
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:47,294
But the Finals are at Lord's,
right?

171
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:53,281
So Mr Man Singh, if and when
India reaches the Final,

172
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,229
we shall happily issue you the pass.

173
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:56,931
OK.

174
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:09,831
Inswinger.

175
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:16,123
When you bowl an inswinger,
must you telegram the batsman?

176
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:20,280
Hide your grip.
Come on! Again.

177
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:36,763
That's good.

178
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:39,565
Where were you, brother?

179
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:44,070
- Learning a lesson.
- What lesson?

180
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:47,807
Just that we may have gained
our independence 35 years ago,

181
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:53,014
but we haven't yet won respect,
Captain.

182
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:08,974
Ballu.

183
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:20,356
A girl? In Ballu's room?

184
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:24,274
Yes! She must've just showered
because her hair was wet.

185
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:28,354
- And Ballu?
- Must have been in the shower?

186
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:30,837
Why weren't they bathing together?

187
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:31,899
I'll find out.

188
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,550
Do you plan to rub their backs
with soap?

189
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:37,381
No! It can't be Ballu.

190
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,226
It just can't be him.

191
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:42,154
He just got engaged to Simran.

192
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,136
There was a girl near the nets.

193
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,499
Maybe it was her.

194
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,564
Kaps...

195
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,024
Thank you, Kaps.

196
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:06,171
What is it?

197
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,485
Catch!

198
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:45,754
<i>Another wicket down for India.</i>

199
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:47,608
<i>They're looking in trouble here.</i>

200
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:49,884
Just 82 for 5.

201
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,929
Not a very good start to
their World Cup preparations.

202
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:54,568
The team is hopeless.

203
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,887
Don't lose face here.

204
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:59,211
We'll be disgraced.

205
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:02,421
At least win one match. Just one.

206
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:06,431
Kapil Dev!

207
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:08,446
Kapil Dev!

208
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,728
Autograph, please.

209
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,719
I'm a fast bowler too.

210
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:22,591
- Do you drink milk too?
- Yes.

211
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:25,518
If you come to watch the match,
then cheer loudly.

212
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:28,606
But I can't come.

213
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:32,013
Because Papa says India never wins,

214
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,871
so why waste precious money
on tickets.

215
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:46,573
Kapil, in the run up
to the World Cup,

216
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:48,594
your team has lost
3 practice matches.

217
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:51,811
One against a minor county.

218
00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:54,717
You talk...

219
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,101
You talk like fast bowler.

220
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:02,486
Can you talk slow like spin bowler?

221
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,576
My hand little tight in English.

222
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:10,731
What do you think your team's
chances are in the World Cup?

223
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,786
We here to win!

224
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:18,331
To win the World Cup?

225
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,707
What else we here for?

226
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,060
In the history of the World Cup,

227
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,318
the West Indies haven't lost
a match.

228
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,591
Not one!

229
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,148
Michael Holding.

230
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:40,071
He's known as "Whispering Death."

231
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:46,367
It's like a bullet,
if it hits you

232
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:48,402
you're dead.

233
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,855
That's Andy Roberts.

234
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:54,180
He's called the "Hitman".

235
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,654
He kills them one by one.

236
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,950
Kapil, tomorrow you're meeting the
Queen at Buckingham Palace.

237
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,413
What will you say to her?

238
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:17,778
I'll get her blessings, so
we will win the World Cup.

239
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,419
And that's Marshall.

240
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:24,734
The shortest, but the fastest.

241
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:34,031
And there's Big Bird.
Joel Garner.

242
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:38,443
He's 6ft 8".

243
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:42,655
His outstretched hand is 3ft,
then he jumps 2ft,

244
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,285
so his ball comes at you
from a height of 12 feet.

245
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:49,021
And at 150kms per hour.
Time to run for cover!

246
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,500
Shut up!

247
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:53,109
Is this cricket or a horror film?

248
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,781
Why scare everyone?

249
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,525
No, no. Sir, no!

250
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:01,561
Kapil was just being enthusiastic.

251
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:04,236
Our return is confirmed for June 20th,

252
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:05,953
before the semi-finals.

253
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,229
<i>Talk later. I'm off to
Buckingham Palace.</i>

254
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,278
<i> There's a protocol meeting.</i>

255
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,170
Once the Queen approaches
the players,

256
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,524
she will extend her hand out
to them.

257
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:20,784
They must hold the tip
of her fingers gently,

258
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:23,035
and make a small bow
from the neck.

259
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:25,089
Like this.

260
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,762
The team will then proceed to Lord's

261
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:30,658
for the traditional team photographs.

262
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,941
Once you've said, "Your Majesty,"

263
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:38,489
make sure you hold only the tips
of her fingers. Elegantly.

264
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,789
Don't grab hold of her hand.
Got it?

265
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:44,056
Now where do we find elegance?

266
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:48,245
You must have some!
Just look for it!

267
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,764
Maan, we're nervous and you think
it's funny?

268
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:52,542
A waste of time.

269
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:55,188
Are we here to play cricket,
or to act in a Shakespeare play?

270
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,674
Long live the Queen!

271
00:19:56,861 --> 00:20:00,508
Guys, it's tradition.
The Queen will wish you luck.

272
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,209
- Yes.
- The Brit is talking!

273
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,278
Roger, when you meet the Queen,

274
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:07,741
tell her your grandfather
was Scottish. She'll be happy.

275
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:10,638
- Shut up, you bugger.
- You burger!

276
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:14,753
Hey, Cheeka. Watch it!

277
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:16,503
Don't wink at the Queen.

278
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:19,832
- Or you'll land up in jail.
- Shut up!

279
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,264
I'm serious.

280
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:26,864
I'm wearing a new wig for her.

281
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:28,454
Looking smart, Kiri.

282
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:30,925
Is this all right, Your Majesty?

283
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:32,349
Yes.

284
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:36,545
<i>Just do whatever Kiri does.</i>

285
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:41,040
Sunil Valson, heart of our team.

286
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:42,704
Best of luck.

287
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,737
Mohinder Amarnath, Vice-Captain he is.

288
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,753
- Your Majesty.
- Best of luck.

289
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,102
Thank you.

290
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:53,122
Sunil Gavaskar.

291
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:55,546
He don't need
no introduction.

292
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:57,295
I've seen you play before.

293
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,261
Your Majesty, an honour.

294
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,540
Wicket keeper, Syed Kirmani.

295
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:04,814
Your Majesty.

296
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,718
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

297
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,652
Srikkanth, opening batsman.

298
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,300
He not know meaning of defence.

299
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,871
- Your Majesty.
- Best of luck.

300
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,678
Madan Lal, all-rounder.

301
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,061
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

302
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,629
Imran.

303
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,248
- How are you, Kapil?
- All good.

304
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,717
How's practice?

305
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:42,751
Hello, sir. Myself Srikkanth.

306
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:44,474
I'm from the Indian cricket team.

307
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,967
Holding, sir.

308
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,781
Clive sir. Nice to meet you.

309
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:51,004
Sir, big fan!

310
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,606
- Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

311
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:01,098
Gentlemen, line up, please.

312
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:05,681
- Maan, let's go.
- We'll stand in the usual order.

313
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:09,630
Time for the photograph.

314
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,072
Hey, giant! No one will see me.

315
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:21,316
Everybody, look into the lens.

316
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:23,197
Stand aside, Maan.

317
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:55,643
Can I say something, Captain?

318
00:22:56,817 --> 00:23:01,237
You're the first man who said
we will win.

319
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:05,913
The journalists kept firing
questions at you

320
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,629
and you kept saying:

321
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:09,701
"We will win!"

322
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,905
A true freedom fighter!

323
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:17,301
Ever since I was a kid,
my mother told me:

324
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:18,738
"Win and come back home, son!"

325
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,658
No best of luck! Just win.

326
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,689
Bravo! Inspiration.

327
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:27,226
Inspire the whole team as well.

328
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:29,661
The hotel is quite far away.

329
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:31,177
We have a match tomorrow.

330
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:32,453
Let's have a meeting.

331
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:34,468
Why? Everyone knows what
they're supposed to do.

332
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:36,586
Tomorrow's the first World Cup match.

333
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,999
Captain, we should talk.

334
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:43,614
Maan, I don't know how
to give a speech.

335
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:46,048
Listen, everyone. Hey!

336
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:48,348
Team meeting!

337
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,510
There are seven senior players here.

338
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,513
What I can say?

339
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,850
Gentleman! The Captain.

340
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:12,199
Tomorrow, match very important.

341
00:24:16,284 --> 00:24:18,897
Cheeka, you hit!

342
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:20,288
OK, brother.

343
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:22,746
Dilip, you strong.

344
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,979
Kirti, you focus.

345
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,322
Your problem there.

346
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:30,332
Sandy, hit them hard.

347
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,277
Yash, you're a lion.

348
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:39,996
Kiri, you'll be the wicket keeper.

349
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:43,482
That's what I do in every match, Kaps.

350
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:48,947
Enough?

351
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:51,356
Inspiration!

352
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,696
Like people says,

353
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:02,136
taste the success once,

354
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,579
tongue want more!

355
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:12,986
Captain.

356
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:14,861
Remember what your mother told you.

357
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:21,231
Just come home a winner!

358
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,688
Thank you.

359
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,989
I think team meeting is over.

360
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:42,004
<i>I don't know what you say,</i>

361
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:44,996
I don't know what he say

362
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:48,058
<i>I don't know what you say,</i>

363
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:50,997
<i>I don't know what you say,</i>

364
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,940
<i>I want to dance and play</i>

365
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,925
<i>I want to dance and play</i>

366
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:00,075
<i>I want to play the game
of cricket</i>

367
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:03,596
<i>I want to play the game
of cricket</i>

368
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:07,789
<i>The historical field at Old Trafford.</i>

369
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,020
<i>Today is India's first match
in the World Cup.</i>

370
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,907
<i>They're up against the champions,
West Indies.</i>

371
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:18,036
<i>Both teams are ready to enter
the ground.</i>

372
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,015
- <i>- But rain is causing a delay.</i>
- Oh no, it's raining there.

373
00:26:22,274 --> 00:26:24,558
<i>There's one thing we do know,</i>

374
00:26:24,773 --> 00:26:28,695
<i>India have never won a single
game in the World Cup.</i>

375
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:33,669
<i>Unless you chose to remember that
game against East Africa</i>

376
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,164
<i>in 1975.</i>

377
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:37,258
I would count that.

378
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,151
I was Man of the Match in that game.

379
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:42,106
- Oh, I had forgotten.
- Ah, now you know.

380
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,500
<i>But the fact is, my dear friend,</i>

381
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,382
<i>the West Indies are here to win</i>

382
00:26:46,502 --> 00:26:48,671
this Cup for the third time in a row.

383
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:51,449
<i>The rain gods have probably saved</i>

384
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,200
the Indians from facing a crushing defeat.

385
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:19,588
<i>So the covers are coming off
and play should begin soon.</i>

386
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,726
<i>I guess the Indians didn't pray enough.</i>

387
00:27:21,846 --> 00:27:23,417
It's stopped raining.

388
00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:26,730
- Shut the idiot up!
- Let them speak.

389
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,408
<i>The World Champions are stepping</i>

390
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:30,807
<i>onto the ground to a rousing reception</i>

391
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:32,451
- by their legions of fans.
- Sunshine!

392
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:36,753
<i>India is in Group B along
with two World Cup giants...</i>

393
00:27:38,571 --> 00:27:40,032
<i>The 4th team, Zimbabwe, are playing</i>

394
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:41,451
Australia today at Trent Bridge.

395
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:43,069
It's me or the West Indies.

396
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:46,411
<i>Windy conditions and a moist wicket</i>

397
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,572
will add sideways movement

398
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,893
<i>to the lethal West Indies attack.</i>

399
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:52,742
<i>This will be no easy task
for the opening batsmen,</i>

400
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:56,663
<i>Sunil Gavaskar and
Krishnamachari Srikkanth.</i>

401
00:27:58,185 --> 00:28:02,387
Sunny, why is the wicket keeper
standing so far away?

402
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:05,447
Hey, man. Why you standing
so far from the wicket, man?

403
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,126
You'll soon find out, man.

404
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:08,406
You'll soon find out.

405
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:10,177
"Find out?"
Find out what?

406
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:12,323
- Good luck, Cheeka.
- Good luck, Sunny.

407
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:15,872
<i>World Cup, 1983!
India's first match.</i>

408
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:19,684
<i>They're playing against the West Indies,
the strongest team in the world.</i>

409
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:23,847
Make him smell the leather, Mikey.

410
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:28,307
Play!

411
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:41,693
Well bowled, Mikey.

412
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:42,958
Well bowled.

413
00:28:43,078 --> 00:28:44,635
Too good for him.

414
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:46,997
Get it?

415
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:53,523
Too quick, Mikey.

416
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:55,118
He can't see
the ball.

417
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:09,200
<i>This is the first time Srikkanth
is playing against the West Indies.</i>

418
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,731
Make him smell the ball, Mikey.

419
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,497
Let's get him.

420
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,614
Too fast for him, Mikey.

421
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:24,977
What happened, man?

422
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,617
Too fast for you?

423
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,121
<i>Now the ball is in Andy Roberts's hands.</i>

424
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:34,566
<i>Facing him is India's renowned
batsman, Sunil Gavaskar.</i>

425
00:29:34,764 --> 00:29:38,773
<i>The Indian batsmen are being
severely restricted by the bowlers.</i>

426
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:41,489
They really need to breakout now.

427
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:44,399
- Catch it!
- That's the first one, Mikey.

428
00:29:46,612 --> 00:29:49,374
<i>Catches the outside edge.
An easy caught behind.</i>

429
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:52,009
<i>Srikkanth made 14 runs
and is out!</i>

430
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,978
- Catch it!
- Howzat?

431
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:01,831
Got him.

432
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:05,285
<i>India is in big trouble now. Two
wickets down in quick succession.</i>

433
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:08,655
<i>I don't think the Indians can
quite see the ball, Farokh.</i>

434
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,560
<i>It's moving too fast for them.</i>

435
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,197
Not a single boundary
for India till now.

436
00:30:17,228 --> 00:30:19,416
Can you see the scoreboard?

437
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:22,496
Why do we bother?

438
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,851
<i>Yashpal faces Garner's bowling.</i>

439
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:30,155
<i>Brilliant shot!</i>

440
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,221
<i>Yashpal hits a beautiful cover drive.</i>

441
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:34,689
The ball crosses the boundary like a bullet.

442
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:39,496
<i>Yashpal Sharma has hit
India's first boundary.</i>

443
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:54,435
<i>Another four! Great batting by
these two players.</i>

444
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:56,825
That's his 'baadaam' shot.

445
00:30:56,945 --> 00:30:57,463
His signature shot!

446
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,627
<i>India have recovered from
their shaky start.</i>

447
00:30:59,747 --> 00:31:01,852
- Yash is hitting well.
- Yes.

448
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:03,911
What do you say now?

449
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,901
Sharma and Patil seem to be
seeing the ball pretty well.

450
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:10,355
Well, yes. I would have
to agree with that.

451
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:12,002
Gomy!

452
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,334
<i>Yashpal is playing pace well.</i>

453
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:16,790
<i>Clive has now brought in a spinner.</i>

454
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:20,645
<i>Gomes is coming in to bowl.</i>

455
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:24,533
<i>Sharma hits him too!</i>

456
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:25,953
<i>He sweeps it to deep square leg.</i>

457
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:27,287
Holding can't get there in time.

458
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,641
- That's it, guys.
- Good shot. Yash, son.

459
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:33,157
<i>Patil hits a straight drive over
the bowler's head.</i>

460
00:31:33,277 --> 00:31:34,454
<i>The ball crosses the boundary.</i>

461
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:37,790
<i>What a partnership between
Yashpal and Patil!</i>

462
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,844
<i>Patil is clean bowled by Gomes.</i>

463
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:50,332
<i>The Haryana hurricane,
Kapil Dev, walks in.</i>

464
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,363
<i> The score is 125/4.</i>

465
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:56,758
<i>Gomes coming into bowl.</i>

466
00:31:56,878 --> 00:32:00,639
<i>Kapil hits it for a quick single.</i>

467
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:04,168
<i>Great shot by Yashpal! 4 runs.</i>

468
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:07,788
- Catch it.
- Yeah.

469
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:12,317
<i>Kapil Dev heads to the pavilion.
He's out with only 6 runs.</i>

470
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:15,715
Oh no! Kapil is out for only six runs.

471
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,051
Oh, get it.

472
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:25,990
That's it.

473
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:35,222
<i>50 runs up for Yashpal Sharma.</i>

474
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,532
<i>That's on the pads.</i>

475
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,872
<i>India now 214/6.</i>

476
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:03,131
Come on!

477
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,751
<i>Clean bowled! Ending a game
changing play by Yashpal.</i>

478
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:11,272
<i>A well-deserved standing ovation.</i>

479
00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:13,752
<i>A great innings.</i>

480
00:33:13,923 --> 00:33:17,943
<i>India now at 243/7.</i>

481
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:24,262
<i>That knock by Yashpal was truly
not expected, was it?</i>

482
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:25,798
<i>9 boundaries.</i>

483
00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:28,731
<i>It's the highest score by
an Indian batsman in any World Cup.</i>

484
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:31,714
<i>Looks like the Indians want to
be taken seriously this time.</i>

485
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,658
<i>262 for 8.</i>

486
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,457
That's a good score
put up by the Indian batsmen!

487
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:37,542
<i>Wouldn't you say?</i>

488
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:40,110
<i>Well, yes, but that basically means</i>

489
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:44,555
<i>the West Indies middle order will
also get some batting practice today.</i>

490
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:48,058
<i>Kapil to Greenidge.</i>

491
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,742
West Indies get off the mark.

492
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:55,968
<i>That's a great shot.</i>

493
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:57,939
And it's a boundary!

494
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,045
<i>Sandhu to Greenidge.</i>

495
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:04,466
Smashing cover drive for 4!

496
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:09,856
<i>Yashpal throws the ball
from the covers. It's a direct hit.</i>

497
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,311
<i>And Haynes is out.</i>

498
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:13,298
That's an important wicket for India.

499
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,649
<i>And in walks probably the greatest</i>

500
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:23,592
batsman in the world today, Richards.

501
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:37,304
<i>Kapil to Viv.</i>

502
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:41,584
<i>Madan Lal stops it at short square leg</i>

503
00:34:41,756 --> 00:34:43,893
and it's just a single.

504
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:47,089
<i>That's a brilliant square cut by Viv.</i>

505
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:50,559
<i>Richards is making this look too easy.</i>

506
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:01,391
Rain, gentlemen.

507
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,052
Ballu, tell him you'll deal
with him tomorrow.

508
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,603
Drop it! Why make trouble?

509
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:12,760
Tell him.

510
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,267
He won't forget it when he faces
your bowling.

511
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:16,920
He'll be shit scared.

512
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,377
Scared? Madipaa, he's Viv Richards!

513
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:20,558
He whacks so hard.

514
00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:21,842
Even the ball gets terrified.

515
00:35:21,962 --> 00:35:25,469
- Scared? As if!
- So what if he's Viv Richards?

516
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:27,489
Remember what Kaps said?

517
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,454
Don't be scared. Just tell him.

518
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,632
Go on!

519
00:35:33,448 --> 00:35:34,832
Hey, listen.

520
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:38,104
What do I say?

521
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:39,814
"I'll deal with you tomorrow."

522
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:42,343
See you tomorrow!

523
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:44,425
Yeah, man.

524
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:49,618
- You're mine.
- Careful what you ask for, man.

525
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:52,601
Now drop it!

526
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:53,574
Want to sing him
a lullaby?

527
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:54,980
<i>Well, that's what you call luck.</i>

528
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:56,398
Saved by the rain.

529
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:58,736
<i>It looked like Viv Richards
was single-handedly</i>

530
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,052
<i>going to take that game away
from the Indians.</i>

531
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:03,387
The game resumes tomorrow.

532
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,169
Let's see what happens.

533
00:36:10,197 --> 00:36:12,040
The match is starting.

534
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:18,096
<i>Second day of play.
Richards on strike</i>

535
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:20,759
<i>and Roger Binny to begin
India's bowling attack.</i>

536
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:23,134
<i>Let's see what Viv does today.</i>

537
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:28,936
<i>Binny running in on this overcast day.</i>

538
00:36:29,593 --> 00:36:31,992
<i>Kirmani catches it and
Viv Richards is out for 17.</i>

539
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,536
<i>Richards is back in the pavilion.</i>

540
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:38,705
Didn't I tell you, Ballu?

541
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,334
Hey, you!

542
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:51,819
Get back to work.

543
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:53,439
You had the day off yesterday!

544
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,900
Go on.

545
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,774
<i>Madan Lal bowls out Bacchus.</i>

546
00:36:57,894 --> 00:36:59,377
What a brilliant delivery!

547
00:36:59,896 --> 00:37:03,190
<i>Binny to Dujon and he's caught
by Sandhu.</i>

548
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,129
<i>West Indies struggling at 107/5.</i>

549
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:08,533
<i>Shastri to Gomes.</i>

550
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:11,411
<i>Batsman are going for the second.</i>

551
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:12,526
Sandhu gets the ball.

552
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,266
<i>And that's a brilliant run out.</i>

553
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:16,462
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

554
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,458
The mighty West Indies are crumbling.

555
00:37:25,273 --> 00:37:29,824
<i>The champions are
in trouble at 157/9.</i>

556
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:32,294
Big Bird Joel Garner is the last man in,

557
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:34,349
but 106 runs are still needed to win.

558
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,649
<i>That's a big 6 over mid-wicket.</i>

559
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,671
<i>This is the same Andy Roberts who, in 1975,</i>

560
00:37:43,852 --> 00:37:45,941
together with Deryck Murray

561
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:48,888
<i>added 64 runs for a 10th wicket
partnership.</i>

562
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:50,709
<i>They made their team win.</i>

563
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:53,915
<i>Looks like Andy Roberts
and Joel Garner</i>

564
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:56,526
<i>intend to perform the
same miracle today.</i>

565
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:59,792
<i>The West Indies need only
34 runs to win.</i>

566
00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:03,690
Kaps, get Shastri back.

567
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:07,521
They can't play slow spin.

568
00:38:10,317 --> 00:38:11,829
<i>Shastri has been called back.</i>

569
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:13,883
That could be a big risk.

570
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:15,439
<i>The game is at a crucial point.</i>

571
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,306
<i>The West Indies need 34 runs
off 36 balls.</i>

572
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:26,033
<i>India has done the unthinkable.</i>

573
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:28,030
They've defeated the unbeatable.

574
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,052
The invincible West Indies!

575
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:43,262
<i>I was away working for 12 years.</i>

576
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:50,388
<i>I returned with a ring.</i>

577
00:38:55,908 --> 00:38:58,305
<i>India has won!</i>

578
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,094
<i>It's time to dance and sing.</i>

579
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:33,790
Will Kaps get angry with us?
Tomorrow we're playing a match.

580
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,082
How will he find out?

581
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,210
He must've had his milk
and gone to sleep.

582
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:41,853
Let's go!

583
00:39:44,794 --> 00:39:46,963
Tomorrow's a match day.

584
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,926
Fix your hair.

585
00:39:54,165 --> 00:39:55,557
Where to, gang?

586
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:59,236
We've won the first World Cup match.
Why not celebrate?

587
00:39:59,457 --> 00:40:01,332
- You coming?
- No, sir.

588
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:04,758
I'm captain in the day.
Patla is the night Captain.

589
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:09,373
They aren't as experienced
as you are on fast pitches.

590
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:11,856
Put your helmet on.

591
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:21,415
If I see someone yawning tomorrow,
they've had it.

592
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,165
Kirti, you trouble-maker!

593
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:27,457
Where are you going, Kaps?

594
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:31,415
The ball has stained my trousers.
It look bad.

595
00:40:31,624 --> 00:40:34,540
- I'm taking it to the laundry.
- Has your family sent you money?

596
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:39,290
We get only £15 a day.

597
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:42,058
Laundry will cost you about £12.

598
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:45,290
Buy a new pair of trousers
instead.

599
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:47,982
- So?
- Wash them yourself.

600
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,290
I haven't even washed a hanky
in my life.

601
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:58,025
Nor have you wiped out the
West Indies team!

602
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:01,378
There's a first for everything.

603
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:04,962
<i>Being young is a carefree time</i>

604
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:08,763
<i>We're ready to falter and fall</i>

605
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:12,040
<i>This no age anyway</i>

606
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:14,661
<i>To be all grown up</i>

607
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,957
<i>Crazy thoughts flood all our hearts</i>

608
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:23,920
<i>Let's cross all boundaries</i>

609
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,957
<i>This no age anyway</i>

610
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:29,723
<i>To be all grown up</i>

611
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:36,415
Jimpa, I managed it in £1.

612
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,998
Cricket teaches you many things.

613
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:43,191
<i>Why lose out on fun?</i>

614
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:47,038
<i>For fear of the others</i>

615
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:50,974
<i>So what if the world disapproves?</i>

616
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:53,290
<i>So be it</i>

617
00:41:53,415 --> 00:41:57,083
<i>Let us go a little wild</i>

618
00:41:57,203 --> 00:42:00,804
<i>Why be all serious now?</i>

619
00:42:00,924 --> 00:42:04,665
<i>We'll follow our hearts</i>

620
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,337
<i>And do what it says</i>

621
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:12,045
<i>Let us go a little wild</i>

622
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:15,790
<i>Why be all serious now?</i>

623
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:19,643
<i>We'll follow our hearts</i>

624
00:42:19,763 --> 00:42:23,373
<i>And do what it says</i>

625
00:42:23,493 --> 00:42:27,072
<i>Let us go a little wild</i>

626
00:42:27,192 --> 00:42:30,711
<i>Why be all serious now?</i>

627
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,423
<i>No authority scares us</i>

628
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,956
<i>What's there to fear?</i>

629
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:43,248
And the man of the match, Madan Lal.

630
00:42:43,373 --> 00:42:48,151
<i>India wins rather comfortably,
with 5 wickets and 23 overs to spare.</i>

631
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:52,125
<i>With two back-to-back wins,
India now on top of Group B.</i>

632
00:42:53,398 --> 00:42:57,128
<i>Let us go a little wild</i>

633
00:42:57,248 --> 00:43:00,745
<i>Why be all serious now?</i>

634
00:43:00,957 --> 00:43:04,669
<i>We'll follow our hearts</i>

635
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:06,438
Cheeka!

636
00:43:06,615 --> 00:43:08,065
Congrats.

637
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,417
Hey!

638
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:14,829
<i>What's there to fear?</i>

639
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,683
I've never seen so many people.

640
00:43:17,415 --> 00:43:20,207
Man Singh, Kapil! Fantastic!

641
00:43:24,223 --> 00:43:26,548
- Hello, Wankhede sir.
- You won two matches!

642
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:30,498
Mishra-ji, write a headline story
on the team.

643
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:33,072
Sure, sir.
They've won two matches.

644
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,538
Even if they had to return to
India tomorrow, it's OK.

645
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,332
No one's going anywhere.

646
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:44,248
You're booked to leave
on the 25th, right?

647
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:45,915
Yes.

648
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:55,477
What'll he do here till then?
Does Kapil want to watch the Finals?

649
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,373
He intends to play in the Finals.

650
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,457
I'm off.

651
00:44:05,748 --> 00:44:07,814
"Play in the Finals!"

652
00:44:08,457 --> 00:44:12,133
If we changed our tickets
from June 25th,

653
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:14,678
must we pay a cancellation fee?

654
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:17,748
Why would you care if we stayed
till the 25th?

655
00:44:17,873 --> 00:44:19,748
Just tell me about
the cancellation charges.

656
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,165
How much? Really!

657
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,768
Then don't change the booking.

658
00:44:29,056 --> 00:44:32,644
I was only asking to pass time.

659
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:37,200
<i>And I can say this specially after
the fall of the first few wickets.</i>

660
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:51,248
<i>In the other match today at Leeds,
West Indies beat Australia by 101 runs.</i>

661
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:53,659
<i>An aggressive comeback after
their humiliating defeat to India.</i>

662
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:55,154
Brother.

663
00:44:55,702 --> 00:44:57,169
Free dinner?

664
00:44:57,606 --> 00:44:58,675
Let's go.

665
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,319
Ma'am, this is Kapil - Kapsy.

666
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,291
Jimmy, our Vice-Captain.

667
00:45:05,506 --> 00:45:08,457
This is Mr and Mrs Natrajan
from Madurai.

668
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:10,160
And their daughter, Kalyani.

669
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:13,775
- She cooks very well, they say.
- That's nice.

670
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,397
Shall we eat?

671
00:45:18,618 --> 00:45:20,266
It's delicious.

672
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:23,040
The dosas are very good. Did you mix
the batter yourself?

673
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,284
No, we get it from India.

674
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,344
I've had five dosas already.

675
00:45:28,748 --> 00:45:31,664
Please don't count.
This is also like your house only.

676
00:45:31,832 --> 00:45:33,665
Kalyani enjoys cooking very much.

677
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,008
Really nice.

678
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:38,815
You've won two World Cup matches.

679
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:41,364
Now you should marry.

680
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:55,457
She says you've won two matches,

681
00:45:55,748 --> 00:45:57,743
so you should settle down.

682
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,082
Cheeka is well settled.

683
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:05,233
He got married to a lovely girl
in March.

684
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,540
Didn't you tell them?

685
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:22,258
Congratulations.

686
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:25,410
Congratulations.

687
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:29,754
Thank you.

688
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:41,748
Did you have to tell them the truth
like Raja Harishchandra?

689
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,082
A few more dosas would've been nice.

690
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,457
- You rascal! Shall I tell Vidya?
- Kapsy!

691
00:46:49,082 --> 00:46:51,748
It's hard finding a vegetarian
South Indian family.

692
00:46:51,873 --> 00:46:54,998
You can find Punjabis everywhere.

693
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:58,290
South Indian families are rare.

694
00:46:59,457 --> 00:47:04,832
A wife fills the heart.
Food fills the belly.

695
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:07,228
You can't mix the two.

696
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:11,097
The end of my dosas.

697
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:15,248
He missed out on dessert,
that's why he's mad.

698
00:47:22,475 --> 00:47:24,814
- Hello.
- How are you?

699
00:47:25,195 --> 00:47:26,248
Simran...

700
00:47:26,373 --> 00:47:28,964
Sat Sri Akal.

701
00:47:29,248 --> 00:47:32,119
Say hello from me.

702
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:33,457
She says hello.

703
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:35,540
Hello-ji, sister-in-law.

704
00:47:35,724 --> 00:47:38,915
We won't tell you about Julie.

705
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,415
Simran, I'll call you
from the lobby.

706
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:44,123
- These idiots are teasing me.
- Wait. Who's Julie?

707
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:46,790
There is no Julie.
He was just kidding.

708
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:49,332
Let me call you from the lobby.
OK?

709
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:53,207
Do you want my engagement
to be called off?

710
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:56,337
Now she won't get Julie
out of her mind.

711
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:00,441
Julie, I love you!

712
00:48:00,707 --> 00:48:02,248
Julie speaking.

713
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:03,788
Lala-ji!

714
00:48:06,915 --> 00:48:12,253
Who is Julie?
No, not Julie. I said July.

715
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:14,962
Lala-ji, all the boys were sitting here.

716
00:48:15,082 --> 00:48:17,707
They want a short holiday
before going home.

717
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:19,910
So, we'll be back in July not June.

718
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:23,147
Everything's fine.
Do you want to talk to Jimmy?

719
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,207
He isn't picking up?
One minute.

720
00:48:27,332 --> 00:48:28,582
Yes.

721
00:48:28,702 --> 00:48:31,256
He was right here.

722
00:48:33,373 --> 00:48:34,489
Jimmy!

723
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:37,224
He must be somewhere in the hotel lobby.

724
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,415
No, Lala-ji. No way.

725
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:41,582
He never goes out at night.

726
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:43,078
He's not here.

727
00:48:43,373 --> 00:48:46,404
He's gone to sleep, Lala-ji.

728
00:48:46,832 --> 00:48:48,207
Should I wake him up?

729
00:49:02,994 --> 00:49:05,025
Hello. Papa.

730
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:11,524
What happened?

731
00:49:13,457 --> 00:49:15,248
Go, look for Jimmy.

732
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:17,534
- Here he is.
- Jimpa, where were you?

733
00:49:17,957 --> 00:49:18,457
Why?

734
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:21,837
- Lala-ji called.
- You should've said I was asleep.

735
00:49:22,015 --> 00:49:23,957
- He told me to wake you up.
- Then?

736
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:26,316
Then I imitated your voice, but...

737
00:49:26,436 --> 00:49:27,415
But what?

738
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:28,623
Lala-ji said:

739
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:31,415
"Kirti, I'm not just Jimmy's father
but your father too."

740
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:32,999
I hung up.

741
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:35,837
Must be Lala-ji.

742
00:49:35,957 --> 00:49:38,748
I'm in trouble, thanks
to your free dosas.

743
00:49:38,873 --> 00:49:39,998
I warned you.

744
00:49:40,123 --> 00:49:41,790
Don't get trapped by free food.

745
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:44,305
- The dosas have cost you heavily.
- Yash, shut up.

746
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:53,415
What else did Lala-ji say?

747
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:57,678
- Just keep batting.
- He must've said something else.

748
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,998
Watching you is hurting my muscles.

749
00:50:02,123 --> 00:50:03,538
Go easy!

750
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,649
Look at this photographer!

751
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,355
I'm the Man of the Match
and he's photographing you.

752
00:50:13,998 --> 00:50:15,582
It's simple, brother.

753
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,332
Whoever pops the champagne cork
gets photographed.

754
00:50:18,707 --> 00:50:20,707
They need action too.

755
00:50:22,048 --> 00:50:23,587
Oh, I look handsome.

756
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:30,040
Captain, we've won two matches.

757
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:32,873
Sure we're not overconfident?

758
00:50:34,038 --> 00:50:35,707
Kapil Dev.

759
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:38,651
Oh, fast bowler!

760
00:50:41,883 --> 00:50:44,545
You won two matches.

761
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:47,792
I made a flag for your next match.

762
00:50:48,123 --> 00:50:49,082
It's a beautiful.

763
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:53,795
<i>Still undefeated, India arrives at
Trent Bridge to face Australia.</i>

764
00:50:53,915 --> 00:50:56,712
<i>Sunil Gavaskar is apparently injured
and has been left out.</i>

765
00:50:56,832 --> 00:50:58,721
<i>Can this cost them the match?</i>

766
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:05,207
<i>Kapil Dev strikes early.
Australia are 11/1.</i>

767
00:51:06,957 --> 00:51:10,123
<i>What a shot by Chappell!
A smashing boundary.</i>

768
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,953
<i>Chappell displaying a tremendous
array of strokes.</i>

769
00:51:18,832 --> 00:51:20,503
<i>That's been dropped.</i>

770
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:24,207
<i>Chappell given a life by Roger Binny.
This could be costly.</i>

771
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:29,123
<i>And how Chappell is punishing the
Indians for that missed opportunity.</i>

772
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:30,332
Catch it.

773
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:33,040
<i>The Captain clearly looks frustrated
at his players.</i>

774
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,540
<i>Too many missed opportunities.
Too many.</i>

775
00:51:35,665 --> 00:51:38,707
<i>Well, I hate to say this, but the
Indians look like amateurs today.</i>

776
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:40,832
<i>Chappell has destroyed
the Indian bowling.</i>

777
00:51:40,957 --> 00:51:42,614
<i>He hits a well deserved century.</i>

778
00:51:42,734 --> 00:51:45,197
<i>And Australia are in a commanding
position at lunch.</i>

779
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:13,722
<i>Walking many nights towards
a dawn</i>

780
00:52:14,237 --> 00:52:20,284
<i>This is not the dawn of our dreams</i>

781
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:22,403
<i>After some dismal
fielding from India,</i>

782
00:52:22,523 --> 00:52:25,398
<i>Kapil Dev is taking the
bowling attack to Australia.</i>

783
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,037
Great bowling, skipper.

784
00:52:28,157 --> 00:52:29,565
Congratulations on the fifer.

785
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:37,739
What's wrong, Kaps?

786
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:39,519
The match isn't over yet.

787
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,434
You know he's pulled his
hamstring, but he's trying.

788
00:52:46,214 --> 00:52:48,421
I expect more from Roger.

789
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:51,126
He better than that.

790
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,751
Kaps, the game is getting tough.

791
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:57,925
- We will not lose easily.
- We must win, Jimpa.

792
00:52:58,045 --> 00:53:03,877
<i>Walking many nights towards
a dawn</i>

793
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:11,371
<i>This is not the dawn of our dreams</i>

794
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,840
<i>The road ahead seems without end</i>

795
00:53:18,118 --> 00:53:19,390
Sorry, Jimpa.

796
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:24,795
<i>Without Gavaskar, India's task of
chasing 321 is going to be a difficult one.</i>

797
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:27,904
<i>It shall not dampen our spirits</i>

798
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:31,455
<i>It shall rise again</i>

799
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,776
<i>This spirit of ours</i>

800
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:37,493
<i>This spirit of ours</i>

801
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:41,503
<i>This spirit of ours</i>

802
00:53:41,623 --> 00:53:44,839
<i>This spirit of ours</i>

803
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:05,925
<i>Kapil is the only one with 5 wickets
and a 40 off 27 balls to his name.</i>

804
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:11,331
<i>The Captain did lead by example, but
India eventually loses by 162 runs.</i>

805
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:14,562
<i>A huge, huge crushing defeat!</i>

806
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:19,324
Kapil, a true Captain's
innings today.

807
00:54:20,688 --> 00:54:23,829
So what? We still lost
the match, Maan.

808
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:27,179
320 runs! We were hammered.

809
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:30,260
It looked like we hardly played.

810
00:54:33,527 --> 00:54:35,724
If you accept defeat early
then how will you fight?

811
00:54:37,635 --> 00:54:41,199
If anyone is injured,
Wally will take his place.

812
00:54:47,172 --> 00:54:48,365
How is leg?

813
00:54:49,598 --> 00:54:50,815
Better.

814
00:54:51,242 --> 00:54:53,648
Sunny, it high time you get run.

815
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,282
Cheeka, you have to control anger.

816
00:55:02,407 --> 00:55:05,240
All the time playing rash shot.
Not require.

817
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,139
What about the fielding?

818
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,679
Sunny Bhai!

819
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:20,305
Don't, Maan Bhai.

820
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:30,646
I don't understand why he's talking
to his team in English?

821
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:34,740
Do you know,

822
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:39,772
Kapil thinks in Punjabi
then translates it into English.

823
00:55:41,073 --> 00:55:46,609
What he meant was - how long will
runs hide from you?

824
00:55:46,729 --> 00:55:49,240
You're going to score,
come what may.

825
00:55:50,157 --> 00:55:52,413
His English is all wrong
but his sentiment is right.

826
00:55:55,491 --> 00:55:56,782
He's right.

827
00:55:58,405 --> 00:56:00,131
I must score.

828
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:05,740
Not for my own sake,
but for the sake of the team.

829
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:07,454
Yes.

830
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,894
Kapil is the team's heart,
you are the team's balance.

831
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:15,985
They can't do without you.
He knows that too.

832
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,615
Anyway, I won't be able
to play tomorrow.

833
00:56:18,865 --> 00:56:20,699
We need you tomorrow.

834
00:56:20,824 --> 00:56:24,189
You're the only one the West
Indies bowlers are scared of.

835
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,075
My foot's still swollen.

836
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:32,227
- Yes, but...
- Sorry.

837
00:56:43,907 --> 00:56:47,293
<i>India is going to play the defeated
West Indies again.</i>

838
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:53,157
<i>Gavaskar has proven he's the greatest
threat to the West Indies so far.</i>

839
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,615
<i>Kapil Dev is making a major error
by dropping him now.</i>

840
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:03,875
Skipper, my hamstring is feeling
much better now.

841
00:57:04,328 --> 00:57:05,985
Let me bowl.

842
00:57:15,311 --> 00:57:18,301
OK, Humphrey. You bowl today.

843
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:36,185
<i>Let's be clear about this.
The West Indies want revenge.</i>

844
00:57:36,305 --> 00:57:38,064
You can see it in their eyes.

845
00:57:38,184 --> 00:57:40,657
<i>After their great upset in the
first match of the World Cup,</i>

846
00:57:40,782 --> 00:57:44,781
<i>the West Indies want to prove that
they're the greatest team in the world.</i>

847
00:57:44,901 --> 00:57:49,182
<i>The manner in which they demolished
the Australians in their second match</i>

848
00:57:49,302 --> 00:57:52,292
<i>is enough to put a chill down
the spine of any team.</i>

849
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:57,990
<i>Greenidge caught at first slip
off Kapil Dev.</i>

850
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:03,717
<i>The West Indies are 17/1. Looks like the
Indians have come ready for battle.</i>

851
00:58:04,044 --> 00:58:08,358
<i>Here comes the best batsman
in the world, Richards.</i>

852
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:30,551
<i>That should be a four.</i>

853
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:34,271
<i>No! Stopped by Binny.
Stopped a certain boundary there.</i>

854
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:55,204
<i>Looks like Richards has
chosen this match</i>

855
00:58:55,385 --> 00:58:59,126
<i>for the team's march towards
another World Cup Final.</i>

856
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:14,329
<i>A masterclass by the two greats of
International cricket.</i>

857
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,484
<i>Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards.</i>

858
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:27,269
<i>That's a big one! I've not seen
a ball hit so far in a long time.</i>

859
00:59:27,394 --> 00:59:30,237
<i>It lands straight on the roof
of the pavilion.</i>

860
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:41,817
<i>West Indies at a massive 282.</i>

861
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:46,352
<i>Sunny seemed fit when I saw him
walk in the nets.</i>

862
00:59:46,824 --> 00:59:49,162
<i>Do you think he
really has been rested?</i>

863
00:59:49,594 --> 00:59:51,283
<i>The best of players go through
a bad patch.</i>

864
00:59:51,403 --> 00:59:54,537
<i>And I'm sure he'll be back.
I know him. He's a great player.</i>

865
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:57,602
<i>Yes, but this is the West Indies
that they're facing.</i>

866
00:59:57,852 --> 01:00:00,553
<i>And who knows them better
than Sunny Gavaskar.</i>

867
01:00:00,673 --> 01:00:02,395
Come on, Andy.

868
01:00:12,393 --> 01:00:14,513
<i>Andy Roberts running in to bowl.</i>

869
01:00:18,499 --> 01:00:20,897
<i>And that delivery almost took
Srikkanth's head off.</i>

870
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,596
<i>Srikkanth slashes
and he's caught behind.</i>

871
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:31,057
<i>India lose an early wicket.</i>

872
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:33,576
Where you going, boss?
The pavilion's over there.

873
01:00:39,992 --> 01:00:41,980
<i>Mohinder Amarnath, the next man in.</i>

874
01:00:45,135 --> 01:00:46,563
<i>And that's another one. A big one.</i>

875
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:49,804
<i>India have lost both their openers
in the first 10 overs.</i>

876
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,914
Fiery Andy, Fiery!

877
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:03,699
<i>That one hit Vengsarkar
right in the ribs.</i>

878
01:01:03,819 --> 01:01:06,922
<i>This looks like a battlefield,
rather than a game of cricket.</i>

879
01:01:22,902 --> 01:01:24,798
<i>India rebuilding quite well.</i>

880
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:30,660
<i>Indians thrilled by this 50-run
partnership between Jimmy and Dilip.</i>

881
01:01:30,852 --> 01:01:32,259
<i>That was a fast one from
Malcolm Marshall.</i>

882
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:35,414
Good stuff, Maco.
Lots of fire, buddy.

883
01:01:41,107 --> 01:01:43,342
Don't worry about it, man.

884
01:01:47,521 --> 01:01:50,214
Sunny knows about me.
You'll soon find out too.

885
01:01:50,947 --> 01:01:52,048
Good shot, Dilip.

886
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:56,035
They say he's the new Gavaskar.
Give him some respect, Maco.

887
01:01:58,276 --> 01:02:02,711
<i>Dilip standing up to one of the fastest
most hostile overs seen in the World Cup.</i>

888
01:02:36,313 --> 01:02:41,405
<i>Ball after ball after ball of
hostile short-paced bowling.</i>

889
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,422
<i>Dilip Vengsarkar simply could not
avoid that one.</i>

890
01:02:47,452 --> 01:02:49,237
<i>He's wincing in pain on the ground.</i>

891
01:02:49,357 --> 01:02:52,325
<i>Dilip was getting on top
of the West Indian bowling.</i>

892
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:25,508
<i>This is not the same Indian team
that landed in England,</i>

893
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:29,931
<i>and this is not the same West Indies
team they met a week ago.</i>

894
01:03:38,011 --> 01:03:39,883
A little bit faster, sir.

895
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,803
<i>Marshall not letting up on his pace.</i>

896
01:03:56,925 --> 01:04:00,022
<i>Pulled away for 4 by one of the
best players of pace.</i>

897
01:04:14,997 --> 01:04:17,204
<i>With Jimmy Amarnath
still at the crease,</i>

898
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:20,548
<i>there's a chance of India
taking up the challenge.</i>

899
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,018
Bowler!

900
01:04:25,884 --> 01:04:28,034
And that brings up the fifty
for Amarnath.

901
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:31,880
<i>The balls are coming like bullets, but
ever since Dilip Vengsarkar was hit,</i>

902
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:35,435
<i>Jimmy Amarnath is giving it back
to the West Indian pacers.</i>

903
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:37,532
<i>Gomes to Patil.</i>

904
01:04:38,654 --> 01:04:41,194
<i>And he's gone, caught
and bowled by Larry Gomes.</i>

905
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:44,178
<i>India now 130/3.</i>

906
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:48,578
- Shall we leave?
- Wait. Kapil Dev is coming on.

907
01:04:52,577 --> 01:04:53,801
<i>Kapil joins Jimmy on the field</i>

908
01:04:53,926 --> 01:04:55,725
<i>at the crucial moment in the match.</i>
- Kapil Dev!

909
01:04:55,845 --> 01:04:57,369
<i>All eyes are on the Captain.</i>

910
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:59,525
<i>The Captain is off
to a flying start.</i>

911
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:03,038
<i>India reaches 160
with four wickets down.</i>

912
01:05:05,238 --> 01:05:09,562
<i>The Captain and Vice-Captain
put up a brave 50-run partnership.</i>

913
01:05:10,946 --> 01:05:13,505
<i>A valiant innings
of 80 comes to an end.</i>

914
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:16,377
Battered on the elbow, chest
and even on the face.

915
01:05:16,497 --> 01:05:21,123
<i>Amarnath stood and hooked bravely
at every opportunity for three hours. </i>

916
01:05:21,945 --> 01:05:23,598
Howzat, Umpire?

917
01:05:23,718 --> 01:05:26,746
<i>Roger Binny is out.</i>

918
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:28,517
Catch it. Yeah!

919
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:31,312
<i>And what a catch!
Absolutely brilliant.</i>

920
01:05:38,013 --> 01:05:40,134
<i>Kirmani bowled by Marshall
for a duck.</i>

921
01:05:40,651 --> 01:05:42,395
No, no, no.

922
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:49,042
<i>India all out in the 54th over, falling
short by a huge margin of 66 runs.</i>

923
01:05:49,162 --> 01:05:50,787
<i>West Indies have had their revenge.</i>

924
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:52,778
<i>Their key batsmen
in hitting form and</i>

925
01:05:52,984 --> 01:05:55,484
<i>their fearsome pace attack
being too much for the Indians.</i>

926
01:05:55,604 --> 01:05:57,498
<i>Today it looked like
a bloody battlefield.</i>

927
01:05:57,618 --> 01:06:02,025
<i>India in deep trouble now,
having lost 2 matches in a row.</i>

928
01:06:31,152 --> 01:06:32,787
Seven stitches.

929
01:06:35,311 --> 01:06:36,454
The doctor said,

930
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:41,547
Dilip can't play in this World Cup.

931
01:07:13,426 --> 01:07:18,883
<i>So what if the heart is broken</i>

932
01:07:19,124 --> 01:07:23,833
<i>It still beats and quickens
as before</i>

933
01:07:23,953 --> 01:07:29,522
<i>Life runs through our veins</i>

934
01:07:29,642 --> 01:07:35,185
<i>We shall keep our promises</i>

935
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:40,750
<i>The desire of every heart</i>

936
01:07:40,984 --> 01:07:47,784
<i>Together we shall fulfill</i>

937
01:07:53,065 --> 01:07:55,599
Kapil Dev!

938
01:07:58,016 --> 01:08:00,311
Kapil Dev!

939
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:09,466
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

940
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:15,046
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

941
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:20,789
<i>Let it fly on high</i>

942
01:08:20,927 --> 01:08:26,496
<i>Proudly wave your country's flag</i>

943
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:32,146
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

944
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:37,939
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

945
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:43,476
<i>Let it fly on high</i>

946
01:08:43,683 --> 01:08:49,969
<i>Proudly wave your country's flag</i>

947
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:54,200
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

948
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:58,266
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

949
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:27,159
627, Kirmani, Dilip.

950
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,029
Patla, found your room?

951
01:09:29,776 --> 01:09:30,707
Yeah!

952
01:09:30,827 --> 01:09:34,431
Shall I ask the people in the lobby
to share the room with me?

953
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,330
Why are you making
a scene, Patla?

954
01:09:37,736 --> 01:09:39,784
The wives are coming.
Please manage.

955
01:09:39,904 --> 01:09:41,281
And our girlfriends?

956
01:09:42,266 --> 01:09:43,881
Take them to the garden.

957
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:46,323
Treat them to ice cream.
Whisper sweet nothings!

958
01:09:46,443 --> 01:09:49,569
Say good night then go back
to your room. OK?

959
01:09:50,427 --> 01:09:52,469
Just listen, Maan.

960
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:56,485
If you play games at night,
you'll be useless on the field.

961
01:10:28,372 --> 01:10:29,252
So sorry, Kapil.

962
01:10:29,372 --> 01:10:32,294
You have a match tomorrow.
How long were you waiting?

963
01:10:32,414 --> 01:10:34,294
- Three hours.
- Three hours!

964
01:10:34,414 --> 01:10:35,905
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

965
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:38,294
Why was the flight so late?

966
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:40,247
You know how it is.

967
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:42,622
Everything is late in India.

968
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:45,001
I was reading an article about

969
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:48,622
a man who applied for a
phone line 18 years ago.

970
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:50,289
He still hasn't got it.

971
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:54,854
Just imagine, 18 years for
a phone line. Too much!

972
01:10:55,488 --> 01:10:59,414
- What news back home?
- Everyone's thrilled.

973
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:02,164
You've won two matches.

974
01:11:02,363 --> 01:11:04,164
And we lost two.

975
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:11,039
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes, I am.

976
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:14,016
Come on.

977
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:23,372
When I was sixteen,

978
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:25,929
I went to the CCI camp.

979
01:11:27,185 --> 01:11:30,866
We bowled all day
and got two rotis to eat.

980
01:11:31,475 --> 01:11:35,122
I asked them: "What's this?"
I went to complain to the camp head.

981
01:11:35,433 --> 01:11:37,436
His name was Keki Tarapore.

982
01:11:38,205 --> 01:11:41,335
"Sir, I'm a fast bowler,
two rotis aren't enough for me."

983
01:11:41,455 --> 01:11:43,247
He laughed.

984
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:46,164
"Son, India doesn't have
fast bowlers.

985
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:50,539
- "Make do with what you get."
- "Sir, I'm not here to make do."

986
01:11:50,914 --> 01:11:54,205
I kept fighting and finally
I was given four rotis.

987
01:11:54,473 --> 01:11:57,830
Four years later when I had taken
100 wickets,

988
01:11:57,997 --> 01:12:01,414
I went to the CCI and thanked
Mr Tarapore and said:

989
01:12:01,762 --> 01:12:04,758
"Because of you, there are
fast bowlers in India now."

990
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:10,830
Rom, if people say:
"This Indian team is useless."

991
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,664
It makes no difference.
I'll give my answer on the pitch.

992
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:17,414
But when they say:
"Kapil, you've done enough."

993
01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:19,914
It makes me furious.

994
01:12:20,289 --> 01:12:24,414
If "enough" makes them happy,
then wait 18 years for a phone.

995
01:12:25,164 --> 01:12:27,747
I'm not here to do "enough".

996
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:31,252
When people talk like that,
I want to smash their faces.

997
01:12:31,372 --> 01:12:32,958
Hello!

998
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,691
Tomorrow's a big match.

999
01:12:36,756 --> 01:12:38,289
It's a do and die.

1000
01:12:42,414 --> 01:12:46,033
- What's wrong?
- You mean "Do or die"?

1001
01:12:46,414 --> 01:12:47,914
Whatever!

1002
01:12:50,482 --> 01:12:52,580
Smash what you want there.

1003
01:12:58,884 --> 01:13:01,335
<i>The BBC are not
showing this match.</i>

1004
01:13:01,455 --> 01:13:03,455
<i>Do you think that's reflection
of the fact</i>

1005
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,060
<i>we're not going to see
anything exciting today, Farokh?</i>

1006
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:09,774
<i>Well, it's a crucial match for India.
We find ourselves in a must win situation.</i>

1007
01:13:09,945 --> 01:13:13,205
<i>India must be still recovering
from the double thrashing</i>

1008
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:15,830
<i>they received from the West Indies
and Australia.</i>

1009
01:13:15,997 --> 01:13:20,080
<i>If they win today by a huge margin,
they're still in the tournament.</i>

1010
01:13:20,205 --> 01:13:21,247
<i>If not, so long!</i>

1011
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:23,961
- I'm fifth down.
- <i>Happy journey India!</i>

1012
01:13:24,164 --> 01:13:26,252
Play well so I don't need to bat.

1013
01:13:26,464 --> 01:13:29,414
I'll shower now. I'll see you
at fielding.

1014
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,247
- Must you make us late?
- The boys take time to come.

1015
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:41,122
We don't need them.
We're not going to war.

1016
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:42,773
We will miss the Indian batting.

1017
01:13:46,314 --> 01:13:49,452
<i>Gavaskar at the crease. It's good
to see the Little Master back.</i>

1018
01:13:49,747 --> 01:13:51,247
<i>Rawson coming in to bowl.</i>

1019
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,973
<i>And that hits his pads
and he is gone.</i>

1020
01:13:54,093 --> 01:13:57,330
<i>Gavaskar goes for a duck in
the first over of the match.</i>

1021
01:14:04,549 --> 01:14:05,727
Catch!

1022
01:14:05,847 --> 01:14:09,375
<i>And what a catch!
Srikkanth also goes for a duck.</i>

1023
01:14:09,495 --> 01:14:10,402
Kaps!

1024
01:14:10,622 --> 01:14:12,539
Kaps, it's two down.

1025
01:14:17,414 --> 01:14:21,002
<i>Caught behind. And would you
believe it, India is 6 for 3.</i>

1026
01:14:21,122 --> 01:14:23,273
Kaps! Three down. Hurry up!

1027
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:27,039
Sardar, let me shower.
The water's nice and hot today.

1028
01:14:27,247 --> 01:14:30,164
We're being hammered and Kaps
is happy about the hot water.

1029
01:14:30,957 --> 01:14:32,167
Kaps!

1030
01:14:32,455 --> 01:14:33,889
<i>Curran to Patil.</i>

1031
01:14:35,328 --> 01:14:37,664
<i>There is an appeal.
And he's given him.</i>

1032
01:14:37,789 --> 01:14:40,138
<i>I cannot believe what's happening
here on this ground.</i>

1033
01:14:40,664 --> 01:14:45,380
Kaps! We're four down!
I swear. Please, hurry.

1034
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,006
Nonsense. Just shut up!

1035
01:14:47,126 --> 01:14:48,604
What do you mean "shut up?"

1036
01:14:48,724 --> 01:14:50,801
It's an important match.
Stop clowning.

1037
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:52,852
Don't take a joke too far.

1038
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:56,039
- What's the score?
- 9 runs.

1039
01:14:56,913 --> 01:14:58,205
Four wickets down.

1040
01:14:59,836 --> 01:15:01,222
<i>Wickets are falling one by one.</i>

1041
01:15:01,342 --> 01:15:04,669
Didn't I tell you?
The boy hasn't got it.

1042
01:15:04,907 --> 01:15:05,914
Captain change.

1043
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,372
- Let the match be over.
- It's over.

1044
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,274
Match is over. World Cup over.
Captain over.

1045
01:15:11,447 --> 01:15:13,590
Another wicket down,
we're not going.

1046
01:15:13,727 --> 01:15:14,969
No point.

1047
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:17,196
<i>We're waiting for the Captain
to enter.</i>

1048
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:20,033
<i>India struggling at 9/4.</i>

1049
01:15:26,192 --> 01:15:27,414
<i>The Captain is rushing out.</i>

1050
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:30,080
<i>It looks like he wasn't prepared
to come out so soon.</i>

1051
01:15:30,205 --> 01:15:32,997
<i>However, it's a moist wicket
and it's windy.</i>

1052
01:15:33,122 --> 01:15:35,798
<i>And there's immense sideways
movement on this green top.</i>

1053
01:15:47,622 --> 01:15:49,294
Brother, what's going on?

1054
01:15:49,414 --> 01:15:51,997
Who knows! They're coming,
they're going.

1055
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:53,502
The ball is swinging.

1056
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,663
Play carefully.

1057
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:00,056
Good morning, Sri.

1058
01:16:08,061 --> 01:16:09,771
What's wrong?

1059
01:16:14,914 --> 01:16:16,833
<i>Another big wicket for Zimbabwe.</i>

1060
01:16:16,953 --> 01:16:20,802
<i>Yashpal departs for 9. The ball
is moving all over the place.</i>

1061
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:23,543
<i>India now 17/5.</i>

1062
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:25,652
Let's go home.

1063
01:16:25,824 --> 01:16:28,618
Amateurs have been sent here
to play cricket. They've messed up.

1064
01:16:28,738 --> 01:16:30,205
<i>It's hard to imagine how a side</i>

1065
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:33,858
<i>that finds itself at 17/5
in 13 overs</i>

1066
01:16:33,978 --> 01:16:35,252
<i>can ever recover in a match</i>

1067
01:16:35,372 --> 01:16:38,946
<i>that will determine their chances
of continuing in this World Cup.</i>

1068
01:16:39,639 --> 01:16:41,089
Wankhede sir.

1069
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:44,247
17 for 5.

1070
01:16:45,914 --> 01:16:48,878
Roger, just stay there.

1071
01:16:49,802 --> 01:16:51,658
Don't give wicket.

1072
01:16:52,539 --> 01:16:54,121
OK, Skipper.

1073
01:16:59,368 --> 01:17:01,190
This is getting over soon.

1074
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,879
- Let's keep the taxi waiting.
- Yes.

1075
01:17:04,591 --> 01:17:06,622
I'll just be back.
Keep the meter running.

1076
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,460
OK.

1077
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,112
<i>Traicos to Binny.</i>

1078
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,099
<i>That's a beautiful straight drive.</i>

1079
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,810
<i>And that should be 4 runs.</i>

1080
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:23,141
<i>Shot! Beats the fielder.
Four runs.</i>

1081
01:17:25,539 --> 01:17:27,289
<i>That's a beautiful shot
by Roger Binny.</i>

1082
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:31,496
<i>Looks like India is finally
creeping back into this game.</i>

1083
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:39,428
<i>Did you speak too soon, Farokh?</i>

1084
01:17:39,548 --> 01:17:43,401
<i>That's the sixth wicket
down for just 77.</i>

1085
01:17:44,937 --> 01:17:46,777
<i>Shastri mistimes a slower ball.</i>

1086
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:49,925
<i>And is caught at mid-off.</i>

1087
01:17:50,153 --> 01:17:52,705
<i>That's the seventh
one gone for just 78.</i>

1088
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:56,039
<i>This is truly a disaster
unfolding here.</i>

1089
01:17:56,289 --> 01:17:59,956
<i>Doesn't look like India
is getting past the 100 mark.</i>

1090
01:18:00,687 --> 01:18:02,503
You're free to go to the hotel.

1091
01:18:03,403 --> 01:18:04,985
See you there.

1092
01:18:06,455 --> 01:18:09,621
We're not going anywhere.
We're staying.

1093
01:18:20,183 --> 01:18:23,789
Madipaa,
just hold on to your wicket.

1094
01:18:24,417 --> 01:18:25,794
I'll look after the score.

1095
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:28,374
Don't worry, Kaps.
I'll stay put.

1096
01:18:29,027 --> 01:18:30,497
<i>Contrasting emotions here.</i>

1097
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:33,103
<i>Zimbabwe fans enjoying
a beautiful afternoon</i>

1098
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:36,794
<i>while the Indians are miserable
with their team's performance.</i>

1099
01:18:37,091 --> 01:18:39,028
<i>Nice shot by Kapil.</i>

1100
01:18:41,203 --> 01:18:42,965
<i>Curran to Kapil.</i>

1101
01:18:43,657 --> 01:18:45,657
<i>Another boundary.</i>

1102
01:18:47,124 --> 01:18:50,929
If we make 100 runs we'll save face.

1103
01:19:08,789 --> 01:19:10,638
<i>What a hit that is from the Captain!</i>

1104
01:19:10,758 --> 01:19:12,779
He's hit a sixer!

1105
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:15,750
He's hit a sixer!

1106
01:19:25,414 --> 01:19:27,917
<i>Looks like that hit has woken up
the Indian players</i>

1107
01:19:28,081 --> 01:19:30,700
<i>from their slumber
in the dressing room.</i>

1108
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,521
<i>There's hope while
he's still out there.</i>

1109
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:44,137
<i>And Madan Lal sweeps that for four.</i>

1110
01:19:46,332 --> 01:19:49,919
<i>Curran to Kapil
and another boundary.</i>

1111
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:51,988
Turn around.

1112
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:54,292
Turn around.

1113
01:19:54,486 --> 01:19:57,080
<i>Kapil hitting the ball all around
the park now.</i>

1114
01:19:57,664 --> 01:20:01,247
<i>At lunch Kapil and Madan Lal have
given some semblance of an innings.</i>

1115
01:20:01,539 --> 01:20:04,122
<i>36 overs down, Kapil is at 50.</i>

1116
01:20:04,242 --> 01:20:09,442
<i>But India are at 124/7 and
still in serious trouble.</i>

1117
01:20:13,164 --> 01:20:16,643
If we make a 150-runs.
We'll go with respect.

1118
01:20:18,943 --> 01:20:20,705
We're not going anywhere, Ballu.

1119
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:25,205
What happen, happen!
We still have 24 overs.

1120
01:20:26,747 --> 01:20:28,853
We fight till end.

1121
01:20:36,997 --> 01:20:39,789
Bring the sword out, Yash.

1122
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,414
The sword?

1123
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:45,873
Mongoose bat!

1124
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,372
...couple of early wickets.

1125
01:21:04,852 --> 01:21:06,268
He's got the mongoose.

1126
01:21:07,591 --> 01:21:09,480
<i>Kapil brings out the mongoose bat.</i>

1127
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,455
<i>Better batting conditions post lunch,
encouraging him to counter-attack.</i>

1128
01:21:13,943 --> 01:21:16,142
<i>He puts that bat to good use.</i>

1129
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:19,740
<i>Curran bowls again. Kapil hits a
second boundary of the over</i>

1130
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,867
<i>and Curran looking
a little frustrated.</i>

1131
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,597
<i>Kapil unleashing a furious assault
on the bowlers.</i>

1132
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,320
Good, Kapsi. Come on, Kapsi!

1133
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,950
<i>And Madan Lal's caught behind.</i>

1134
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:41,039
<i>A 62 run partnership that
stabilized India comes to an end.</i>

1135
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:45,867
<i>The Indian score still
precariously placed at 140/8.</i>

1136
01:21:57,452 --> 01:21:59,371
Who moved?

1137
01:22:01,455 --> 01:22:03,358
- To pee.
- Don't move.

1138
01:22:06,951 --> 01:22:10,247
We'll get them before we're down.

1139
01:22:11,832 --> 01:22:13,890
They can't get rid of us.

1140
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:17,342
Listen, everyone.

1141
01:22:18,164 --> 01:22:20,122
Till Kapil is batting,

1142
01:22:20,634 --> 01:22:22,347
no one moves.

1143
01:22:24,821 --> 01:22:26,485
- Pee...
- Statue-like.

1144
01:22:26,814 --> 01:22:29,890
You hit. I'm right here.

1145
01:22:33,923 --> 01:22:37,479
Try getting me out.
Just try it.

1146
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:42,168
- Romi.
- No one move.

1147
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:54,106
<i>Kirmani off to a strong start.
That's a boundary.</i>

1148
01:22:56,497 --> 01:22:58,207
I'm right here too, Kapsi.

1149
01:23:01,249 --> 01:23:03,408
<i>And the onslaught continues.</i>

1150
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:17,003
<i>That's mistimed and it's a six.</i>

1151
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:19,289
You're just a bloody slogger!

1152
01:23:19,414 --> 01:23:22,220
<i>Seems to be an exchange of words
between Kapil and Kevin.</i>

1153
01:23:24,705 --> 01:23:28,097
<i>That's another big one.
It's a straight hit over the wicket.</i>

1154
01:23:28,217 --> 01:23:30,525
Oh, bloody hell!

1155
01:23:32,164 --> 01:23:35,372
And that was a straight six.
Right into the commentator's box.

1156
01:23:35,497 --> 01:23:38,036
India now 164 for 8.

1157
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:42,252
<i>The Indian fans delighted
by Kapil's century.</i>

1158
01:23:42,372 --> 01:23:45,085
<i>Who would have believed, under
the circumstances?</i>

1159
01:23:45,316 --> 01:23:48,360
<i>A first for an Indian
in a limited overs match.</i>

1160
01:23:50,146 --> 01:23:53,664
If we make 175 runs.
We'll manage it.

1161
01:23:53,994 --> 01:23:55,348
What did you say?

1162
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:57,705
First it was 100 then 150
and now 175?

1163
01:23:57,914 --> 01:23:59,740
Is there no end to your demands?

1164
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,705
Fix a target score and get them
to play accordingly.

1165
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:05,442
- He's shooting off his mouth.
- OK, 200.

1166
01:24:37,585 --> 01:24:39,846
Bloody hell! That's my car.

1167
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:53,822
<i>Kapil has crossed 150.
An unbelievable knock.</i>

1168
01:24:54,846 --> 01:24:57,039
<i>I think the spectators
need helmets now.</i>

1169
01:24:57,565 --> 01:24:59,855
No one move. I'll be back
in a minute.

1170
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:02,039
I can't control it anymore.

1171
01:25:02,221 --> 01:25:04,484
It's your responsibility
if it goes wrong.

1172
01:25:04,698 --> 01:25:06,241
- Why?
- Agree?

1173
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:08,241
- No.
- So, wait.

1174
01:25:09,666 --> 01:25:12,977
- Are you going to wet your pants?
- Just about. Get lost!

1175
01:25:15,883 --> 01:25:18,650
Gentlemen, what's the world record?

1176
01:25:28,372 --> 01:25:31,318
Good shot, Kapil! Good shot!

1177
01:25:31,802 --> 01:25:33,844
171 by Glenn Turner.

1178
01:25:37,308 --> 01:25:41,372
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we're about
to see a world record being broken.</i>

1179
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:16,830
You've been hitting sixers.

1180
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,875
How come they're clapping
for a single?

1181
01:26:20,532 --> 01:26:21,994
Who knows!

1182
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:24,329
Ask the Umpire.

1183
01:26:26,322 --> 01:26:27,372
What happen?

1184
01:26:27,803 --> 01:26:28,763
What happened?

1185
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,236
You just broke the
bloody World Record!

1186
01:26:31,955 --> 01:26:33,372
Congratulations!

1187
01:26:40,955 --> 01:26:43,237
- Come on, Kapil!
- Congratulations!

1188
01:27:18,164 --> 01:27:20,414
You're a true freedom fighter.

1189
01:27:28,901 --> 01:27:32,747
<i>He walked in when India were just
9 runs for 4 wickets.</i>

1190
01:27:32,867 --> 01:27:37,497
<i>He faced 138 balls, 16 boundaries
and 6 sixes.</i>

1191
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:40,669
He took India to 266 for 8,

1192
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:45,871
<i>and he himself finished with
an historic 175, not out.</i>

1193
01:27:50,539 --> 01:27:53,247
<i>Today we saw undoubtedly</i>

1194
01:27:53,372 --> 01:27:57,997
<i>one of the greatest knocks in the
history of this beautiful game.</i>

1195
01:28:17,582 --> 01:28:20,994
<i>Pain keeps telling your strong arms</i>

1196
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:24,462
<i>If you stop now, you're in trouble</i>

1197
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:29,232
<i>Pain keeps telling you</i>

1198
01:28:29,352 --> 01:28:32,656
<i>You can will defeat away</i>

1199
01:28:32,776 --> 01:28:36,354
<i>You're no ordinary man</i>

1200
01:28:36,557 --> 01:28:40,493
<i>You could never pass by unnoticed</i>

1201
01:28:40,613 --> 01:28:44,394
<i>There is no one like you</i>

1202
01:28:44,514 --> 01:28:48,485
<i>This field is all yours,
power is in your hands</i>

1203
01:28:48,605 --> 01:28:50,490
<i>Don't stop now</i>

1204
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:52,635
<i>Don't bow down now</i>

1205
01:28:52,755 --> 01:28:54,520
<i>Don't let tiredness overcome you</i>

1206
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,491
<i>Never give up, never give up</i>

1207
01:28:56,611 --> 01:28:58,360
<i>Don't cower down</i>

1208
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,314
<i>Don't hide your strength</i>

1209
01:29:00,434 --> 01:29:02,286
<i>Don't let it falter</i>

1210
01:29:02,406 --> 01:29:05,234
<i>Never give up, never give up</i>

1211
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:12,247
<i>What a shame the BBC
was on strike today.</i>

1212
01:29:12,372 --> 01:29:15,409
<i>The innings Kapil Dev played
today would have been a lesson</i>

1213
01:29:15,529 --> 01:29:17,262
<i>for generations to come.</i>

1214
01:29:17,382 --> 01:29:23,710
<i>Some events wipe out all
differences and unite hearts.</i>

1215
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:27,466
<i>Today we witnessed such an
event at Tunbridge Wells.</i>

1216
01:29:27,664 --> 01:29:31,142
<i>Your country of origin did
not matter nor your age.</i>

1217
01:29:31,372 --> 01:29:37,922
<i>Because everyone who was there
witnessed history in the making.</i>

1218
01:29:38,205 --> 01:29:44,064
<i>Today a player brought victory
to his team single-handedly</i>

1219
01:29:44,289 --> 01:29:52,265
and made many millions of Indians
proudly hold their heads up high.

1220
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,205
£300.

1221
01:29:56,325 --> 01:29:58,664
- Yes, governor.
- It was worth it!

1222
01:29:58,955 --> 01:30:01,032
Kuku has broken a World Record!

1223
01:30:01,152 --> 01:30:04,595
That's why I say you should
drink milk. Yes!

1224
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:07,034
You keep asking why, mister.

1225
01:30:07,205 --> 01:30:10,106
I didn't know we would play so well.

1226
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:15,027
We can make it to the semis now.
Must they start playing badly?

1227
01:30:15,425 --> 01:30:18,703
If India loses face,
so will you, right?

1228
01:30:18,823 --> 01:30:20,987
Stop talking!

1229
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,830
Tell me how much extra
for the flight?

1230
01:30:24,281 --> 01:30:26,622
How am I going to find
that much money?

1231
01:30:32,978 --> 01:30:35,389
You should know which way
your ball will swing.

1232
01:30:43,706 --> 01:30:46,686
Bravo, Ballu! You hid your
inswinger this time.

1233
01:30:47,353 --> 01:30:48,808
Come on. One more.

1234
01:30:58,228 --> 01:30:59,561
What was that? In or out?

1235
01:31:06,019 --> 01:31:08,916
I fought to have you and Ballu
on our team,

1236
01:31:10,353 --> 01:31:13,769
not for you to let the wind
and the pitch do it all.

1237
01:31:19,228 --> 01:31:21,392
When you your potential realise?

1238
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:26,811
Say it softly.

1239
01:31:26,978 --> 01:31:29,394
He'll feel bad.
He's playing well.

1240
01:31:29,514 --> 01:31:31,686
He could play just as well
in his sleep, Maan.

1241
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:34,126
We must make it to the semis.

1242
01:31:35,372 --> 01:31:37,353
Just playing so-so won't do.

1243
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:43,019
You must outdo yourselves
in every match.

1244
01:31:43,853 --> 01:31:45,394
All of us must.

1245
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:50,978
Come on.

1246
01:31:58,394 --> 01:32:00,585
- Aren't you ready?
- No.

1247
01:32:02,144 --> 01:32:04,603
- Kapil is just...
- I said: "No, Ballu."

1248
01:32:04,723 --> 01:32:08,934
- It's the High Commissioner's party.
- Not interested.

1249
01:32:11,561 --> 01:32:14,228
Why, Brit? Are you scared we'll
force you to sing the National Anthem?

1250
01:32:14,353 --> 01:32:16,978
Don't worry. I'll teach you
the words.

1251
01:32:18,144 --> 01:32:20,076
Just knowing the National Anthem
doesn't mean a thing

1252
01:32:20,196 --> 01:32:22,942
if it doesn't swell your
bloody chest every time it's sung!

1253
01:32:30,682 --> 01:32:34,508
No one should make fun of Roger
about the National Anthem.

1254
01:32:34,628 --> 01:32:36,708
- What's wrong?
- He's sulking.

1255
01:32:36,828 --> 01:32:41,142
- What did he say?
- Many things.

1256
01:32:41,951 --> 01:32:44,978
- Something about the National Anthem.
- But what did he say?

1257
01:32:45,169 --> 01:32:50,629
He said: "Bloody chest swelling."

1258
01:32:50,749 --> 01:32:55,743
I can't repeat his words with
as much feeling.

1259
01:32:56,546 --> 01:32:58,123
He moved me.

1260
01:32:59,155 --> 01:33:01,916
Congratulations.
What an achievement! Really!

1261
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:03,381
Thank you so much.

1262
01:33:03,612 --> 01:33:07,056
Kapil, Romi, Man Singh,
meet David Frith.

1263
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:09,245
A very senior journalist.

1264
01:33:09,365 --> 01:33:11,894
Congratulations, Kapil,
on the World Record.

1265
01:33:12,019 --> 01:33:13,353
It's a pity I couldn't watch it.

1266
01:33:13,473 --> 01:33:15,617
You should've. It was glorious.

1267
01:33:15,737 --> 01:33:16,595
Ah, yes.

1268
01:33:16,715 --> 01:33:20,519
But you see that day was also
the clash of the giants at Lord's.

1269
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,454
West Indies vs Australia.

1270
01:33:22,862 --> 01:33:25,019
Now you wouldn't miss that
match for anything. Would you?

1271
01:33:26,937 --> 01:33:28,311
I would!

1272
01:33:28,648 --> 01:33:31,462
It's not every day you get to see
a World Record now, do you?

1273
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,833
No, not at all.

1274
01:33:35,097 --> 01:33:36,936
I'm sure you're proud of him.

1275
01:33:37,056 --> 01:33:39,144
You've done a rather
splendid job, Kapil.

1276
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:42,563
I'm sure you'll go back
a happy man now.

1277
01:33:46,034 --> 01:33:47,645
Hello, Mr. Frith.

1278
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:52,353
We've read your article.

1279
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:53,936
No, Kapil?

1280
01:33:54,769 --> 01:33:56,263
Myself Srikkanth.

1281
01:33:56,612 --> 01:33:59,546
And my beautiful wife, Vidhya.
Come here.

1282
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:03,316
She's shy. We got married just before
the World Cup.

1283
01:34:03,436 --> 01:34:04,938
Congratulations, my dear.

1284
01:34:05,347 --> 01:34:09,095
You know, just after our marriage,
a phone call came.

1285
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:12,499
We've been selected for
the 1983 World Cup they said.

1286
01:34:12,892 --> 01:34:14,220
I thought: "Very good."

1287
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:17,049
So, we booked our tickets.
Bombay to New York.

1288
01:34:17,314 --> 01:34:18,869
A stopover in London.

1289
01:34:19,129 --> 01:34:20,725
With me in this plan...

1290
01:34:20,845 --> 01:34:22,079
Sandy was there.

1291
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:24,144
Roger. Where is Roger?

1292
01:34:25,854 --> 01:34:28,867
Kirti, Kirmani, Shastri.

1293
01:34:28,987 --> 01:34:31,936
We were all going for
a holiday to the US.

1294
01:34:32,269 --> 01:34:35,547
We thought we'd play the World Cup
matches on the way.

1295
01:34:35,667 --> 01:34:38,663
Then we'd go on our honeymoon.
That was the plan.

1296
01:34:39,665 --> 01:34:41,692
Why are you embarrassed?

1297
01:34:41,812 --> 01:34:43,473
You were all there
in the plan, no?

1298
01:34:43,777 --> 01:34:46,777
Maan Bhai, you were
also there in the plan.

1299
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:48,892
You must understand one thing.

1300
01:34:49,135 --> 01:34:51,897
We have never won any match
in any World Cup.

1301
01:34:52,063 --> 01:34:55,679
Before 1983, we beat only
one team - East Africa.

1302
01:34:55,799 --> 01:34:57,936
First of all, there is no country
called East Africa.

1303
01:34:58,061 --> 01:34:59,647
You all know that.

1304
01:34:59,767 --> 01:35:02,254
It's basically a bunch
of Gujaratis put together,

1305
01:35:02,374 --> 01:35:03,948
the Patels and their brothers.

1306
01:35:04,068 --> 01:35:06,494
They just formed a team.

1307
01:35:06,614 --> 01:35:08,282
And that's the only team we beat.

1308
01:35:08,459 --> 01:35:10,302
So now, in 1983, we come here

1309
01:35:10,422 --> 01:35:13,686
and our Captain says we'll beat
the West Indies.

1310
01:35:13,806 --> 01:35:17,414
We thought our Captain
had lost his mind.

1311
01:35:17,534 --> 01:35:19,142
Who is in the team?

1312
01:35:19,262 --> 01:35:21,123
Opening - Gordon Greenidge,
Desmond Haynes.

1313
01:35:21,243 --> 01:35:23,559
Number 3. Viv Richards,
Clive Lloyd.

1314
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:25,186
And the 4 fast bowlers,

1315
01:35:25,311 --> 01:35:28,556
whose names none of us want
to remember for the rest of our lives.

1316
01:35:28,676 --> 01:35:32,355
And Dilip! He definitely
doesn't want to remember.

1317
01:35:32,556 --> 01:35:35,872
And our mad Captain

1318
01:35:36,121 --> 01:35:38,314
says we'll win this match.

1319
01:35:38,434 --> 01:35:42,298
I tell you the Captain has gone mad!

1320
01:35:54,088 --> 01:35:55,555
But Mr Frith,

1321
01:35:57,144 --> 01:35:58,353
he was serious.

1322
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:05,155
And that day we defeated your
"giant" West Indies.

1323
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:12,019
I don't think our mad Captain
is going to go back happy with just...

1324
01:36:12,386 --> 01:36:14,933
"a rather splendid job."
That he's done till now.

1325
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:24,851
He'll be only happy when he's holding
the World Cup in his hands.

1326
01:36:33,336 --> 01:36:36,337
Nothing less will do!
Nothing less.

1327
01:36:58,629 --> 01:37:00,968
Like people say:

1328
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:05,936
"Taste success once...

1329
01:37:06,414 --> 01:37:09,244
"tongue wants more!"

1330
01:37:10,196 --> 01:37:13,019
Kapsi! To our mad Captain.

1331
01:37:13,144 --> 01:37:14,822
- To the World Cup!
- To the World Cup!

1332
01:37:14,942 --> 01:37:17,507
- To the World Cup!
- To the World Cup!

1333
01:37:20,633 --> 01:37:22,644
<i>Racing to the front
leaving everyone behind</i>

1334
01:37:22,769 --> 01:37:24,326
<i>With our heads held high</i>

1335
01:37:24,514 --> 01:37:28,144
<i>We enter the field,
proud in our uniforms</i>

1336
01:37:28,269 --> 01:37:31,998
<i>Now that we are here,
we shall prove our talent</i>

1337
01:37:32,178 --> 01:37:35,065
<i>We shall show our strength</i>

1338
01:37:35,185 --> 01:37:39,629
<i>The strength of passion.
The fire of determination</i>

1339
01:37:39,832 --> 01:37:43,381
<i>The world will learn from us</i>

1340
01:37:46,311 --> 01:37:49,983
<i>We will win, we will win</i>

1341
01:37:50,103 --> 01:37:53,559
<i>India will win</i>

1342
01:37:53,746 --> 01:37:57,496
<i>A prayer in every heart</i>

1343
01:37:57,616 --> 01:38:01,620
<i>The belief of millions</i>

1344
01:38:01,854 --> 01:38:05,107
<i>We shall win, win we shall</i>

1345
01:38:05,308 --> 01:38:08,898
<i>India shall win</i>

1346
01:38:09,078 --> 01:38:12,891
<i>Fulfilling all our promises</i>

1347
01:38:31,601 --> 01:38:34,643
<i>India wins by a huge margin
of 118 runs.</i>

1348
01:38:34,763 --> 01:38:39,005
<i>Roger Binny has broken the back of the
Australians by taking 4 crucial wickets.</i>

1349
01:38:39,955 --> 01:38:40,878
For my team.

1350
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:44,916
<i>India go to the semi-finals and
Roger Binny is the Man of the Match.</i>

1351
01:38:45,496 --> 01:38:46,855
For my Captain.

1352
01:38:48,793 --> 01:38:50,354
Thank you.

1353
01:39:03,323 --> 01:39:05,542
Twenty wounded.

1354
01:39:06,876 --> 01:39:09,788
Four killed in Nawabpur.

1355
01:39:10,955 --> 01:39:13,750
Communal violence continues.

1356
01:39:13,988 --> 01:39:15,978
How will it end?

1357
01:39:16,257 --> 01:39:17,769
Madam!

1358
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:21,519
We've reached the semi-finals
in the World Cup!

1359
01:39:21,768 --> 01:39:25,936
There's communal rioting in India
and you're talking about cricket?

1360
01:39:26,056 --> 01:39:30,228
Sports are above religious
differences.

1361
01:39:31,152 --> 01:39:33,978
Madam, what has cricket
to do with all this?

1362
01:39:34,606 --> 01:39:37,853
Did you know India
is in the semi-finals?

1363
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:38,796
Yes, Madam.

1364
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:42,167
- Does everyone know?
- Yes, Madam.

1365
01:39:42,287 --> 01:39:45,060
- Everyone knows. They're very happy.
- Why?

1366
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,686
Madam, no one believed
it could happen.

1367
01:39:47,913 --> 01:39:50,644
Everyone hoped it would.

1368
01:39:50,824 --> 01:39:53,259
It's a different story
in the big cities,

1369
01:39:53,379 --> 01:39:55,561
- but in small towns like Nawabpur?
- Why not?

1370
01:39:55,944 --> 01:39:58,890
Don't they understand cricket?

1371
01:40:02,468 --> 01:40:05,505
Make this World Cup into a festival.

1372
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:09,282
Get all India watching it on TV.

1373
01:40:10,092 --> 01:40:13,212
The World Cup games
must obsess all of India.

1374
01:40:13,827 --> 01:40:16,575
Will India win the semi-final?

1375
01:40:16,695 --> 01:40:19,840
Will India win the World Cup?

1376
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:27,353
Make sure every home in Nawabpur
can watch the matches live.

1377
01:40:28,116 --> 01:40:31,686
<i>Eight different countries have been
playing in the World Cup.</i>

1378
01:40:31,989 --> 01:40:36,894
<i>The Indian cricket team has made
history by making it to the semi-finals.</i>

1379
01:40:37,014 --> 01:40:42,326
<i>The match will take place
at Old Trafford in Manchester.</i>

1380
01:40:42,446 --> 01:40:45,473
<i>The semi-finals will be played between
India and England.</i>

1381
01:40:45,593 --> 01:40:48,894
<i>You can watch the match
on Doordarshan across the country.</i>

1382
01:40:49,014 --> 01:40:51,712
Grandpa, did you hear?

1383
01:40:51,899 --> 01:40:55,186
The monkeys have broken the antenna.
We'll miss the match.

1384
01:40:55,306 --> 01:40:57,875
- We'll get it repaired tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1385
01:40:58,522 --> 01:40:59,747
There's rioting in the town,

1386
01:40:59,867 --> 01:41:02,686
and you want to watch a match?
No one goes out.

1387
01:41:02,806 --> 01:41:05,103
- Your grandfather?
- Yes, sir.

1388
01:41:05,228 --> 01:41:06,936
How did it happen?

1389
01:41:07,147 --> 01:41:10,853
Heart attack. Massive.
Morning walking and dead!

1390
01:41:11,019 --> 01:41:12,384
That's terrible.

1391
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:14,194
Tomorrow is funeral.

1392
01:41:16,952 --> 01:41:19,061
- In Manchester.
- Manchester?

1393
01:41:19,595 --> 01:41:20,985
Yes, sir.

1394
01:41:21,262 --> 01:41:23,698
All right. Go on then.

1395
01:41:31,065 --> 01:41:34,275
You're a troublemaker.

1396
01:41:44,891 --> 01:41:46,651
Namaste, sister-in-law.

1397
01:41:46,771 --> 01:41:49,228
I was telling you about Julie...

1398
01:41:55,978 --> 01:41:58,824
Simran has broken off
the engagement.

1399
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:01,087
What?

1400
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:04,353
Her brother called.

1401
01:42:05,103 --> 01:42:07,826
He said my house is too small,

1402
01:42:11,186 --> 01:42:13,812
and I couldn't afford to keep
Simran happy on my salary.

1403
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:20,050
He's right.

1404
01:42:20,978 --> 01:42:22,932
We don't earn half as much as
doctors or engineers.

1405
01:42:24,329 --> 01:42:27,961
Why would anyone want
their daughter to marry a cricketer?

1406
01:42:55,407 --> 01:42:56,810
Hey, Kapil...

1407
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,728
Have you read this?

1408
01:42:59,961 --> 01:43:01,245
They say it's a fluke.

1409
01:43:01,365 --> 01:43:03,811
I don't know what the word means.

1410
01:43:04,061 --> 01:43:06,896
'Fluke' means it's pure luck
that we won.

1411
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:09,879
Kapil, you must say
something about this.

1412
01:43:09,999 --> 01:43:11,636
How?

1413
01:43:12,356 --> 01:43:14,978
When I speak English at the
team meetings, you laugh.

1414
01:43:15,103 --> 01:43:16,603
You keep catching me out.

1415
01:43:16,728 --> 01:43:19,309
So, if I said anything to them,
it'd bounce off their heads.

1416
01:43:20,036 --> 01:43:22,978
No, Kapsi, it's not funny.
We won our way here.

1417
01:43:23,516 --> 01:43:27,311
We didn't get to the semi-finals
because of a quota.

1418
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:31,019
What this article deserves

1419
01:43:31,353 --> 01:43:32,859
is what I'm doing.

1420
01:43:34,603 --> 01:43:37,098
You must make a statement, Captain.

1421
01:43:37,335 --> 01:43:38,865
Let's play cricket instead.

1422
01:43:39,103 --> 01:43:42,242
I feel like smashing their faces in.
Aren't you furious?

1423
01:43:42,414 --> 01:43:43,947
Madipaa.

1424
01:43:48,519 --> 01:43:50,416
Why are the West Indies
champions today?

1425
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:57,318
In 1975 when Tony Greg
was England's Captain,

1426
01:43:57,438 --> 01:43:59,853
remember what he said about
the West Indies?

1427
01:44:02,019 --> 01:44:04,269
"We'll rub their faces in the mud.

1428
01:44:05,927 --> 01:44:07,686
"Make them grovel."

1429
01:44:09,228 --> 01:44:12,061
The West Indies didn't react.

1430
01:44:13,186 --> 01:44:15,686
They just went ahead and won
the World Cup twice.

1431
01:44:21,519 --> 01:44:23,978
The way we'll play will be
our answer.

1432
01:44:32,294 --> 01:44:34,103
"Where we come from."

1433
01:44:34,228 --> 01:44:35,459
"We are the England."

1434
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:38,886
<i>You know what happened the last time the
an Englishman said: "We'll make them grovel."</i>

1435
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:41,770
<i>You created the West Indies
killing machine.</i>

1436
01:44:42,036 --> 01:44:44,936
<i>Well, I'll take my chances and
say the same again.</i>

1437
01:44:45,061 --> 01:44:46,957
<i>With people half the height,</i>

1438
01:44:47,077 --> 01:44:49,827
<i>a third of the pace
and a quarter of the ability.</i>

1439
01:44:50,029 --> 01:44:53,691
<i>And remember the history,
in limited overs cricket,</i>

1440
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:57,483
<i>India has never beaten England
in England.</i>

1441
01:44:57,603 --> 01:45:01,280
<i>Maybe this time India
wants to rewrite history.</i>

1442
01:45:08,605 --> 01:45:11,681
"Where we come from."

1443
01:45:11,801 --> 01:45:13,811
"We are the England."

1444
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:16,680
<i>Sandhu being punished
by the English batsman.</i>

1445
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,358
<i>50 up. A promising start indeed
for England.</i>

1446
01:45:20,918 --> 01:45:24,744
- Give Ballu a rest.
- What's wrong?

1447
01:45:24,864 --> 01:45:26,601
His engagement was
called off last night.

1448
01:45:26,721 --> 01:45:27,936
What?

1449
01:45:46,834 --> 01:45:48,311
Come! Come.

1450
01:45:51,553 --> 01:45:56,186
<i>Binny to Tavaré. Azad tries to
stop it, but it's a boundary.</i>

1451
01:45:57,327 --> 01:45:58,603
Has it come?

1452
01:45:59,174 --> 01:46:00,829
No.

1453
01:46:02,047 --> 01:46:04,892
<i>Madan Lal gets hit
for a beautiful cover drive.</i>

1454
01:46:08,668 --> 01:46:10,644
- Has it come?
- No.

1455
01:46:23,655 --> 01:46:25,936
<i>And that brings up the 100
for England</i>

1456
01:46:26,119 --> 01:46:29,654
<i>in the 25th over for the loss
of just two wickets.</i>

1457
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:34,686
<i>The Indians really need to try and
contain the English batsman now.</i>

1458
01:46:37,026 --> 01:46:38,269
And now?

1459
01:46:38,858 --> 01:46:40,186
<i>There's a change of bowler.</i>

1460
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:41,061
The signal is back.

1461
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:43,454
<i>Will Jimmy stop the English batsman?</i>

1462
01:46:47,509 --> 01:46:49,192
<i>Out!</i>

1463
01:46:50,388 --> 01:46:53,061
<i>Jimmy has played just the way
the Captain had hoped.</i>

1464
01:46:53,186 --> 01:46:57,514
<i>The wicket that India desperately needed.
Spectacular bowling!</i>

1465
01:46:57,809 --> 01:46:59,853
<i>Kirti Azad brought into the attack.</i>

1466
01:47:00,756 --> 01:47:02,755
<i>A sweep shot by Lamb.</i>

1467
01:47:03,114 --> 01:47:05,543
<i>That's a direct hit!</i>

1468
01:47:06,062 --> 01:47:09,444
<i>Very, very quick thinking and a fine
piece of cricket by Yashpal Sharma.</i>

1469
01:47:09,564 --> 01:47:11,978
<i>A very important wicket for India to get.</i>

1470
01:47:13,264 --> 01:47:16,050
<i>Jimmy to Gatting, and that's clean bowled.</i>

1471
01:47:16,237 --> 01:47:18,368
<i>A second wicket for Jimmy Amarnath.</i>

1472
01:47:20,721 --> 01:47:22,103
<i>Oh! That's got him.</i>

1473
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:25,743
<i>That ball was kept really low
and Botham is gone for 6.</i>

1474
01:47:25,936 --> 01:47:30,442
<i>The ball hit the stump less than a foot high.
Poor Botham was left high and dry.</i>

1475
01:47:30,562 --> 01:47:34,644
<i>England in real trouble now.
160 for 6.</i>

1476
01:47:34,764 --> 01:47:37,555
<i>The jubilant Indian crowd has
invaded the pitch.</i>

1477
01:47:37,675 --> 01:47:39,936
<i>The situation for England
has become critical.</i>

1478
01:47:40,056 --> 01:47:43,686
<i>Amarnath and Azad are choking off
England's supply of runs.</i>

1479
01:47:43,811 --> 01:47:46,482
Mind the pitch!

1480
01:47:46,602 --> 01:47:48,313
Jimmy, they're spoiling the pitch.

1481
01:47:48,433 --> 01:47:53,269
Kirti, the ball spins or is low.
How did you manage both?

1482
01:47:53,644 --> 01:47:56,644
Kaps, at release time

1483
01:47:56,873 --> 01:47:59,489
I held the ball like this
and I...

1484
01:48:03,784 --> 01:48:06,337
Kaps, sorry.
It's a trade secret.

1485
01:48:06,606 --> 01:48:08,146
I learnt it for the World Cup.

1486
01:48:11,290 --> 01:48:12,686
Well bowled, Kirti!

1487
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:15,902
Kirti, tell me how you did it.

1488
01:48:17,268 --> 01:48:21,124
I couldn't admit to Kaps
that I didn't have a clue!

1489
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:23,272
- What?
- What is it?

1490
01:48:23,499 --> 01:48:26,936
Bowled Botham out. I earned £50.
What more could I want!

1491
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:30,728
<i>Kapil Dev back into the attack.</i>

1492
01:48:31,032 --> 01:48:32,914
<i>And he's clean bowled.</i>

1493
01:48:37,376 --> 01:48:38,853
<i>Kapil to Allott.</i>

1494
01:48:39,285 --> 01:48:42,938
<i>He mistimes that and Patil
catches it at short third man.</i>

1495
01:48:44,155 --> 01:48:46,228
<i>Willis's leg stump goes over.</i>

1496
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:50,644
<i>He goes for nought, and England
are dismissed for a score of 213.</i>

1497
01:48:50,764 --> 01:48:54,485
<i>Kapil gets his 3rd wicket
from the last ball of the 60th over.</i>

1498
01:48:54,605 --> 01:48:58,353
<i>Great recovery from India after a
solid start from the English batsmen.</i>

1499
01:48:58,473 --> 01:49:01,586
<i>The wicket was conducive
to Indian bowlers.</i>

1500
01:49:01,814 --> 01:49:03,980
<i>Round one had a similar wicket</i>

1501
01:49:04,105 --> 01:49:06,858
<i>that helped Kapil's team
defeat the West Indies.</i>

1502
01:49:14,713 --> 01:49:17,145
What's the score?

1503
01:49:18,162 --> 01:49:20,424
England 213. All out.

1504
01:49:20,595 --> 01:49:21,854
England all out!

1505
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:27,939
Patla, you go four down today.
I'll go after you.

1506
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:29,681
What's wrong?

1507
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:31,579
STD.

1508
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:34,378
- What?
- I've got STD.

1509
01:49:35,407 --> 01:49:37,380
I warned you guys.

1510
01:49:37,671 --> 01:49:39,649
- Don't do it with everyone.
- Pass the soda.

1511
01:49:39,856 --> 01:49:41,437
Soda?

1512
01:49:41,646 --> 01:49:43,630
That doesn't cure STD.

1513
01:49:43,755 --> 01:49:46,385
It'll help me burp.

1514
01:49:46,505 --> 01:49:47,902
How can that fix STD?

1515
01:49:48,022 --> 01:49:49,525
It works for me.

1516
01:49:49,713 --> 01:49:52,380
Patla, "acidity!"

1517
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:55,671
Give him a soda, he'll be okay.

1518
01:49:55,796 --> 01:49:57,255
That's what I told you.

1519
01:49:58,877 --> 01:50:00,258
What did you think?

1520
01:50:00,549 --> 01:50:01,767
I thought you had an STD.

1521
01:50:01,948 --> 01:50:04,046
That's what I said.
'Acidity.'

1522
01:50:05,338 --> 01:50:06,713
Hey, Dhadpadango!

1523
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:10,005
Mind where you're going.
Fancy yourself an ace batsman.

1524
01:50:10,213 --> 01:50:12,713
- Calm down! Have a soda.
- All he does is smoke and hit.

1525
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:18,235
<i>Willis to Gavaskar.</i>

1526
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:21,489
<i>Flicks it off his pads
for a boundary.</i>

1527
01:50:29,421 --> 01:50:33,171
<i>Srikkanth uses the pace of the bowler
to beat a third man for a boundary.</i>

1528
01:50:33,694 --> 01:50:36,458
<i>Four handsome runs by Sunil Gavaskar.</i>

1529
01:50:37,907 --> 01:50:40,602
<i>Belligerent blow by this
smashing stroke maker.</i>

1530
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,883
<i>The Little Master is in form.</i>

1531
01:50:59,801 --> 01:51:04,185
<i>It's a solid start to the Indian
innings by Gavaskar and Srikkanth.</i>

1532
01:51:04,305 --> 01:51:06,378
<i>46 for no loss.</i>

1533
01:51:13,396 --> 01:51:15,595
<i>That's the wicket
England wanted badly.</i>

1534
01:51:15,715 --> 01:51:20,238
<i>No opposing team is comfortable as long
as Gavaskar is still at the crease.</i>

1535
01:51:22,046 --> 01:51:23,942
<i>Pulled away for a four.</i>

1536
01:51:24,384 --> 01:51:28,255
<i>Srikkanth on 19,
building his innings well.</i>

1537
01:51:31,252 --> 01:51:33,105
Catch it!

1538
01:51:40,594 --> 01:51:42,640
<i>Srikkanth is out.</i>

1539
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:46,365
<i>Both openers gone in consecutive overs.</i>

1540
01:51:46,485 --> 01:51:48,198
Cheeka is always so careless.

1541
01:51:48,318 --> 01:51:51,169
<i>India at 50/2.</i>

1542
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,633
<i>Marks now, coming in from
a different end.</i>

1543
01:52:05,753 --> 01:52:08,401
<i>Hit firmly to mid-on.
Going for a single.</i>

1544
01:52:12,547 --> 01:52:15,171
<i>Out comes the stump.
Did Sharma make it?</i>

1545
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:19,238
<i>The Umpire, David Evans, is in a
perfect position to make that call.</i>

1546
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:25,227
<i>Not out says the Umpire.</i>

1547
01:52:27,703 --> 01:52:29,671
Sorry, STD.

1548
01:52:30,026 --> 01:52:32,695
Yash, we have a lot of overs left.
Don't take any risks.

1549
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,194
OK.

1550
01:52:34,921 --> 01:52:36,796
I'll hit. Save your wicket.

1551
01:52:36,987 --> 01:52:39,242
- OK, Jimpa.
- Bravo! Be strong.

1552
01:52:40,844 --> 01:52:42,671
<i>Amarnath comes down the pitch.</i>

1553
01:52:43,318 --> 01:52:44,539
<i>It's a six.</i>

1554
01:52:44,659 --> 01:52:46,608
<i>That's 100 for India.</i>

1555
01:52:46,728 --> 01:52:48,319
That's more like it.

1556
01:52:56,141 --> 01:52:57,667
Good shot, Yash.

1557
01:52:58,059 --> 01:53:00,888
Careful. We both can't risk it.

1558
01:53:01,008 --> 01:53:02,654
OK, Jimpa.
No problem.

1559
01:53:04,088 --> 01:53:06,796
<i>He's play that on side.
The fielder giving it chase.</i>

1560
01:53:06,916 --> 01:53:08,920
<i>Unsuccessfully.</i>

1561
01:53:11,982 --> 01:53:13,793
<i>Willis comes in for his second spell.</i>

1562
01:53:13,913 --> 01:53:15,564
Yash.

1563
01:53:20,712 --> 01:53:22,171
<i>That's a magnificent shot.</i>

1564
01:53:22,296 --> 01:53:23,505
<i>Yashpal has made room for himself</i>

1565
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,656
<i>and put it on its way for a
magnificent game changing six.</i>

1566
01:53:26,776 --> 01:53:28,380
Great shot! But why take risks?

1567
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,676
Jimpa, you don't know.

1568
01:53:30,796 --> 01:53:33,286
He insulted me in the Madras match.

1569
01:53:33,691 --> 01:53:34,796
I won't spare him.

1570
01:53:35,005 --> 01:53:36,983
You'll take your Madras revenge
in Manchester?

1571
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:40,666
Brother, it's the semi-finals.
Stay calm.

1572
01:53:41,369 --> 01:53:43,088
OK, big brother.

1573
01:53:43,551 --> 01:53:45,704
You say OK, OK. But you do
as you please.

1574
01:53:46,605 --> 01:53:48,434
Easy.

1575
01:53:52,112 --> 01:53:54,755
<i>Yashpal has flicked it towards
deep square leg.</i>

1576
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:56,202
<i>He takes a single</i>

1577
01:53:56,322 --> 01:53:58,846
- <i>and is trying for a second run.</i>
- Why take the second run?

1578
01:54:10,375 --> 01:54:11,927
<i>And he's out!</i>

1579
01:54:14,231 --> 01:54:15,569
"Where we come from."

1580
01:54:15,689 --> 01:54:17,813
"We are the England."

1581
01:54:18,174 --> 01:54:19,476
You idiot!

1582
01:54:21,928 --> 01:54:25,422
<i>Amarnath returns, making 46 runs.
A crucial wicket.</i>

1583
01:54:27,567 --> 01:54:29,964
<i>India at 142 for 3.</i>

1584
01:54:32,695 --> 01:54:35,755
Yash, hang in there for 60 overs.

1585
01:54:35,959 --> 01:54:38,859
- I'll hit now.
- OK, Patla.

1586
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:48,232
<i>That's a four.</i>

1587
01:54:48,667 --> 01:54:52,011
<i>And that's an excellent 50
for Yashpal Sharma.</i>

1588
01:54:53,338 --> 01:54:55,985
<i>Another half century for Sharma
in this tournament.</i>

1589
01:54:56,105 --> 01:54:57,170
Shall I hit? Or will you?

1590
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:00,005
Tell you what, we'll hit together.

1591
01:55:00,745 --> 01:55:01,939
Not a bad idea!

1592
01:55:05,836 --> 01:55:08,254
<i>Patil showcasing his big hits.</i>

1593
01:55:10,056 --> 01:55:12,452
<i>Sharma continues the onslaught
at the other end</i>

1594
01:55:12,572 --> 01:55:15,206
<i>to the delight of the Indian fans.</i>

1595
01:55:24,282 --> 01:55:26,510
<i>Patil is seriously punishing
the English bowlers.</i>

1596
01:55:26,630 --> 01:55:28,505
Madipaa, let the match be over.

1597
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:32,585
You guys always get the bottle first.
Today it's my turn.

1598
01:55:33,856 --> 01:55:36,140
<i>Patil has hit it for a four.</i>

1599
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:37,593
<i>The score is now 200.</i>

1600
01:55:37,713 --> 01:55:39,421
<i>Indian fans are delighted!</i>

1601
01:55:39,546 --> 01:55:41,588
<i>Patil's entrance has
changed the game again.</i>

1602
01:55:41,713 --> 01:55:44,452
<i>He has once again punished Willis,
just like he did last year.</i>

1603
01:55:44,572 --> 01:55:46,708
Wasn't that Kulwant just there?

1604
01:55:47,387 --> 01:55:49,845
No, sir, no Kulwant.

1605
01:56:07,315 --> 01:56:08,536
<i>It's in the air.</i>

1606
01:56:08,728 --> 01:56:10,166
<i>Allott is getting under it.</i>

1607
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:13,467
<i>And it's...it's a marvellous catch.</i>

1608
01:56:15,171 --> 01:56:16,536
Madipaa!

1609
01:56:20,139 --> 01:56:23,563
<i>Yashpal Sharma walks back.
He's been the pillar of the Indian innings</i>

1610
01:56:25,916 --> 01:56:30,324
<i>India now 205 for 4 as the
Captain walks in.</i>

1611
01:56:36,373 --> 01:56:38,760
<i>Three runs needed for
India to reach the Finals.</i>

1612
01:56:39,254 --> 01:56:40,713
<i>Plays it into the covers.</i>

1613
01:56:41,307 --> 01:56:44,086
<i>That's one, they take another.</i>

1614
01:56:44,463 --> 01:56:46,320
<i>Oh no! There's been an invasion.</i>

1615
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,551
<i>A premature invasion on the field.</i>

1616
01:56:48,671 --> 01:56:51,613
<i>Indian fans celebrating
a bit too early.</i>

1617
01:57:06,656 --> 01:57:08,913
<i>Willis waiting for the field
to be cleared.</i>

1618
01:57:09,234 --> 01:57:11,838
<i>This might just be the last ball
of the match.</i>

1619
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:15,145
Fellows move over.

1620
01:57:16,833 --> 01:57:20,019
<i>Willis asking for a most
unorthodox field.</i>

1621
01:57:20,139 --> 01:57:23,202
<i>He has asked all his players
to move to the off side.</i>

1622
01:57:23,322 --> 01:57:27,451
<i>So that they can escape
if there is another invasion.</i>

1623
01:57:43,162 --> 01:57:47,062
<i>And that's it. It's off the edge
and it goes for a four.</i>

1624
01:57:49,607 --> 01:57:52,950
<i>India is through
to the Finals</i>

1625
01:57:53,171 --> 01:57:56,577
<i>of the 1983 World Cup.</i>

1626
01:58:11,145 --> 01:58:16,980
<i>India is now through to the Finals.
What a historic day for Indian cricket.</i>

1627
01:58:36,211 --> 01:58:38,109
For my father.

1628
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:53,918
Hey, you bloody Pakis!

1629
01:58:54,087 --> 01:58:56,856
Stop playing that stupid
drum and bugger off!

1630
01:58:57,543 --> 01:58:59,213
Shall we go?

1631
01:58:59,565 --> 01:59:01,069
Why should we?

1632
01:59:01,421 --> 01:59:03,877
We won the match
and we can't celebrate.

1633
01:59:04,116 --> 01:59:06,130
- Didn't you hear what he said?
- Play, Jassi.

1634
01:59:06,338 --> 01:59:08,897
- Bugger off!
- Play, Jassi.

1635
01:59:38,562 --> 01:59:40,383
Piss off!

1636
01:59:45,338 --> 01:59:46,546
Never mind!

1637
01:59:47,630 --> 01:59:50,363
Kapil will fix them in the Finals.

1638
01:59:54,169 --> 01:59:55,505
Yes, Papa.

1639
02:00:03,888 --> 02:00:05,201
Lala-ji?

1640
02:00:06,362 --> 02:00:07,374
What did he say?

1641
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,505
He said: "My son,

1642
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:19,588
today you have made me feel
ten years younger."

1643
02:00:30,243 --> 02:00:32,752
Don't tell anyone I'm crying.

1644
02:00:35,078 --> 02:00:37,976
There's a message from
forward post for you, sir.

1645
02:00:38,096 --> 02:00:40,296
Sir, the soldiers want to hear

1646
02:00:40,532 --> 02:00:42,200
the latest score of the Finals

1647
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:45,338
- every ten minutes.
- How do I do that?

1648
02:00:46,173 --> 02:00:47,505
The moment the match starts,

1649
02:00:47,630 --> 02:00:50,869
the Pakistani Major Sadiq
will start firing.

1650
02:00:51,445 --> 02:00:53,025
Do they ever let us hear
the commentary?

1651
02:00:53,546 --> 02:00:56,380
They fire at us whenever
there's a big match on.

1652
02:00:56,671 --> 02:00:59,146
World Cup TV fund.
World Cup TV fund.

1653
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:02,705
Sir, sir!

1654
02:01:02,825 --> 02:01:04,301
World Cup TV fund, sir.

1655
02:01:04,421 --> 02:01:06,857
You want a TV?
But we have a radio in the hostel.

1656
02:01:06,977 --> 02:01:09,176
A TV is a must, sir.

1657
02:01:09,296 --> 02:01:11,945
Radio or TV,
it's the same thing.

1658
02:01:12,892 --> 02:01:15,710
Sir, take my cycle.
Give me your car.

1659
02:01:16,213 --> 02:01:18,463
- Same thing, sir!
- Get lost.

1660
02:01:19,402 --> 02:01:23,806
Good news! If we win,
each player gets 25,000.

1661
02:01:23,926 --> 02:01:25,426
You crazy?
You'll give us 25,000?

1662
02:01:25,546 --> 02:01:28,157
The Cricket Board will.
I just heard it.

1663
02:01:29,004 --> 02:01:30,430
Ever seen 25,000?

1664
02:01:31,130 --> 02:01:32,880
It's probably for the whole team.

1665
02:01:33,692 --> 02:01:34,713
How much?

1666
02:01:34,833 --> 02:01:38,005
25,000, Roger! Just imagine.

1667
02:01:38,215 --> 02:01:40,630
Our Sunny, Gavaskar.

1668
02:01:41,001 --> 02:01:42,296
He used to play cricket here.

1669
02:01:42,416 --> 02:01:44,458
He's broken our windows
so many times.

1670
02:01:44,578 --> 02:01:47,380
But I always returned the ball
to him.

1671
02:01:47,559 --> 02:01:49,897
Children must be encouraged.

1672
02:01:51,546 --> 02:01:53,453
Oh God! There goes our window.

1673
02:01:54,024 --> 02:01:58,286
You fool. Do you think
you're Sunil Gavaskar?

1674
02:01:58,406 --> 02:02:02,192
- How many more tickets?
- At least four more.

1675
02:02:02,312 --> 02:02:03,630
I want four tickets too.

1676
02:02:03,808 --> 02:02:06,338
You're driving me crazy.

1677
02:02:06,541 --> 02:02:08,505
I don't have any tickets
for the Finals.

1678
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:11,046
Don't talk about a ticket
ever again.

1679
02:02:11,171 --> 02:02:12,505
Now hang up!

1680
02:02:13,002 --> 02:02:14,184
What the hell do you want?

1681
02:02:14,304 --> 02:02:16,546
Do you have any hot water
in your bathroom?

1682
02:02:16,671 --> 02:02:18,421
- Is there any hot water?
- Yes.

1683
02:02:18,546 --> 02:02:21,693
Madi, you shower here.
I'll wait downstairs.

1684
02:02:21,813 --> 02:02:23,317
He wants to shower.

1685
02:02:23,637 --> 02:02:25,287
Yes, it'll be done.

1686
02:02:26,097 --> 02:02:27,974
I'll talk to him.

1687
02:02:28,279 --> 02:02:30,009
Thank you, bye.

1688
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:33,463
Kapil, we need more tickets.
They've all arrived.

1689
02:02:33,588 --> 02:02:37,213
- I gave you the four tickets I had.
- I need some more.

1690
02:02:37,338 --> 02:02:39,301
- Hello?
- What "hello?" You "hello."

1691
02:02:39,421 --> 02:02:41,380
Want me to print them myself?

1692
02:02:41,546 --> 02:02:42,813
Come!

1693
02:02:44,013 --> 02:02:44,888
Hi, Romi.

1694
02:02:45,008 --> 02:02:49,047
Kaps, my boss is arriving tomorrow
from Nirlon. I need some passes.

1695
02:02:50,154 --> 02:02:52,256
- How many?
- Two or three.

1696
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:54,140
OK, Sunny. You'll get them.

1697
02:02:54,937 --> 02:02:56,603
- See you.
- Bye.

1698
02:02:59,257 --> 02:03:02,674
- Let me concentrate on the match.
- At least get their rooms organised.

1699
02:03:02,794 --> 02:03:03,638
Tell you what.

1700
02:03:03,758 --> 02:03:06,721
They can sleep here.
I'll sleep in the bathroom.

1701
02:03:24,910 --> 02:03:28,768
I say before, we here to win.

1702
02:03:36,755 --> 02:03:39,152
One question at a time.

1703
02:03:58,903 --> 02:04:00,901
This was your dream.

1704
02:04:02,796 --> 02:04:05,631
It's every cricketer's dream.

1705
02:04:06,808 --> 02:04:08,544
Lord's.

1706
02:04:10,588 --> 02:04:14,796
India has never won a single match
in this stadium.

1707
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:22,609
India has never made it
to the World Cup Finals either.

1708
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:29,722
Are you scared?

1709
02:04:31,857 --> 02:04:33,287
Very.

1710
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:41,266
Kapil Dev is all grown up.

1711
02:04:42,755 --> 02:04:44,930
He's India's cricket Captain.

1712
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:50,382
He's broken a World Record
and even reached the Finals.

1713
02:04:53,338 --> 02:04:58,572
Behind this Kapil Dev
is a small kid, Kuku.

1714
02:05:01,943 --> 02:05:04,893
A kid who played because
he loved playing cricket.

1715
02:05:10,417 --> 02:05:12,424
Play for that boy today.

1716
02:05:27,131 --> 02:05:31,296
Sir, Pakistan's Major Sadiq
is on the hotline.

1717
02:05:31,421 --> 02:05:33,338
The hotline? Now what?

1718
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:35,338
Yes, Major Sadiq?

1719
02:05:38,671 --> 02:05:41,338
Yes. Thank you.

1720
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:53,248
He said we can enjoy the game.
There won't be any firing today.

1721
02:05:56,285 --> 02:05:57,951
<i>Although the English cricket press</i>

1722
02:05:58,076 --> 02:06:01,652
<i>had given India no chance of ever
reaching even the semi-finals,</i>

1723
02:06:01,772 --> 02:06:05,243
<i>India rose to the occasion and
has surprised the cricketing world</i>

1724
02:06:05,368 --> 02:06:08,875
<i>by reaching the World Cup Finals
here at Lord's.</i>

1725
02:06:09,067 --> 02:06:13,186
<i>But of course the favorites
remain the mighty West Indies.</i>

1726
02:06:13,306 --> 02:06:14,310
Sir, one ticket?

1727
02:06:14,435 --> 02:06:17,807
One ticket, sir. Give me one ticket,
my fair friend.

1728
02:06:27,183 --> 02:06:31,391
<i>On this pitch whoever wins the toss
definitely has the upper hand.</i>

1729
02:06:31,511 --> 02:06:33,393
<i>The conditions are best for bowling.</i>

1730
02:06:33,513 --> 02:06:35,293
<i>I think so too, Johners.</i>

1731
02:06:36,241 --> 02:06:37,597
Toss, please.

1732
02:06:37,820 --> 02:06:39,897
That's heads, that's tails.

1733
02:06:45,476 --> 02:06:47,078
Heads!

1734
02:06:50,654 --> 02:06:52,042
Heads it is.

1735
02:06:53,847 --> 02:06:56,583
<i>West Indies wins the toss and
choose to bowl first.</i>

1736
02:06:56,703 --> 02:06:59,501
<i>Advantage West Indies
on this green top.</i>

1737
02:07:00,250 --> 02:07:03,083
Come on, hurry up. Let's go!

1738
02:07:04,813 --> 02:07:06,597
They're here!

1739
02:07:12,749 --> 02:07:13,958
How's the pitch?

1740
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:16,614
It's a green.

1741
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:18,666
Openers, be cautious.

1742
02:07:20,409 --> 02:07:22,274
Specially you, Cheeka.

1743
02:07:23,249 --> 02:07:24,666
Don't throw away wicket.

1744
02:07:25,291 --> 02:07:26,583
OK, Kapsi.

1745
02:07:38,874 --> 02:07:43,708
<i>Openers Sunil Gavaskar and Srikkanth
making their way to the pitch.</i>

1746
02:07:43,828 --> 02:07:47,083
<i>All of India is watching
these two players right now.</i>

1747
02:07:47,249 --> 02:07:50,208
<i>It's the first time the Indian team
has reached a World Cup Final.</i>

1748
02:07:50,333 --> 02:07:52,833
<i>The stadium is packed to the rafters.</i>

1749
02:07:52,958 --> 02:07:58,614
<i>The huge crowds have forced
the organisers to extend the stands.</i>

1750
02:07:59,194 --> 02:08:02,001
Sachin, hurry up!
The match is starting.

1751
02:08:07,791 --> 02:08:10,193
<i>Sunny Gavaskar will face the first ball.</i>

1752
02:08:10,313 --> 02:08:15,658
<i>Every Indian is hoping he builds
on the rhythm he found in the semi-finals.</i>

1753
02:08:15,851 --> 02:08:17,570
Play.

1754
02:08:19,983 --> 02:08:23,572
<i>Hitman Andy Roberts.. tries to play it,
but misses the ball.</i>

1755
02:08:23,692 --> 02:08:25,462
<i>A fiery first ball.</i>

1756
02:08:31,324 --> 02:08:32,666
<i>A good decision leaving that ball.</i>

1757
02:08:32,791 --> 02:08:34,666
<i>Aggressive bowling by Roberts.</i>

1758
02:08:34,791 --> 02:08:37,083
<i>A tense start for the Indians.</i>

1759
02:08:37,314 --> 02:08:40,456
<i>The opening batsmen have to
play with caution.</i>

1760
02:08:43,666 --> 02:08:45,458
<i>Garner to Gavaskar.</i>

1761
02:08:47,098 --> 02:08:49,458
<i>Almost catches the outside edge.</i>

1762
02:08:49,578 --> 02:08:51,666
Come on! Over here!

1763
02:08:54,665 --> 02:08:57,541
<i>The ball rises sharply and
hits Srikkanth on the gloves.</i>

1764
02:08:57,661 --> 02:09:00,291
That was too good for him, Bird.

1765
02:09:05,398 --> 02:09:07,958
<i>5th over and India has only 2 runs
on the board.</i>

1766
02:09:14,546 --> 02:09:15,666
<i>And that's Gavaskar's gone.</i>

1767
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:19,833
<i>Beautifully bowled by Andy Roberts
and he's taken the first Indian wicket.</i>

1768
02:09:19,958 --> 02:09:21,208
<i>That's the one they wanted.</i>

1769
02:09:21,333 --> 02:09:23,749
<i>Gavaskar, the great Indian batsman
with the score at 2.</i>

1770
02:09:23,874 --> 02:09:26,416
So that's first blood
for Clive Lloyd's team.

1771
02:09:27,694 --> 02:09:31,160
<i>That brings one of the best players
of pace to the wicket.</i>

1772
02:09:31,442 --> 02:09:33,369
<i>Can he take the attack to the Windies?</i>

1773
02:09:34,374 --> 02:09:36,502
Jimmy, we love you!

1774
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:40,810
<i>Amarnath pushes the ball
for a quick single.</i>

1775
02:09:40,930 --> 02:09:43,089
<i>West Indies keeping it very tight.</i>

1776
02:09:44,666 --> 02:09:46,190
Good single.

1777
02:09:49,427 --> 02:09:51,886
<i>Garner is unplayable out there
at the moment.</i>

1778
02:09:52,006 --> 02:09:53,513
Well done, Bird. Well done!

1779
02:09:53,833 --> 02:09:56,546
What happened, man?
Too fast for you?

1780
02:09:56,916 --> 02:09:59,879
Cheeka, go easy!

1781
02:09:59,999 --> 02:10:02,833
Jimpa, I can't play slow
and don't know technique.

1782
02:10:02,958 --> 02:10:04,541
If I had technique,
I'd be Sunil Gavaskar.

1783
02:10:04,666 --> 02:10:09,081
I don't know how to play defence.
I only know how to hit.

1784
02:10:10,111 --> 02:10:12,572
Go ahead and hit.

1785
02:10:19,124 --> 02:10:21,339
- Shall I?
- Hit!

1786
02:10:23,343 --> 02:10:25,432
Damn if I do,
damn if I don't.

1787
02:10:26,335 --> 02:10:28,483
Now watch me hit.

1788
02:10:36,018 --> 02:10:38,499
<i>Srikkanth slashes at another short
pitched delivery</i>

1789
02:10:38,624 --> 02:10:40,294
<i>and it flies over the keeper's head.</i>

1790
02:10:40,414 --> 02:10:44,754
<i>Looks like Srikkanth has decided
he's been respectable long enough.</i>

1791
02:10:44,874 --> 02:10:47,810
What happened, man?
Too fast for you?

1792
02:10:48,506 --> 02:10:50,793
Bravo, Cheeka!

1793
02:10:53,916 --> 02:10:58,254
<i>Don't know what the batsmen talked about,
but Srikkanth has changed his game.</i>

1794
02:10:58,374 --> 02:11:00,659
<i>Indian fans are just loving this.</i>

1795
02:11:01,291 --> 02:11:04,441
<i>Amarnath has pulled this towards
deep square leg.</i>

1796
02:11:08,623 --> 02:11:12,058
<i>Oh, what a beautiful shot!</i>

1797
02:11:13,982 --> 02:11:16,708
<i>That was meant to be
the quicker bouncer,</i>

1798
02:11:16,833 --> 02:11:21,640
<i>but Srikkanth was waiting for it
and sent it flying to the boundary.</i>

1799
02:11:23,286 --> 02:11:24,833
<i>And again. Beautiful!</i>

1800
02:11:25,061 --> 02:11:27,769
<i>This is clearly the shot
of the tournament.</i>

1801
02:11:29,208 --> 02:11:32,036
<i>Even the great Vivian Richards
is applauding that shot.</i>

1802
02:11:33,666 --> 02:11:35,806
<i>The Indians are loving this.</i>

1803
02:11:40,333 --> 02:11:41,249
<i>What a shot!</i>

1804
02:11:41,374 --> 02:11:44,379
<i>That's the third time he's smashed
this West Indian pace attack</i>

1805
02:11:44,499 --> 02:11:46,874
<i>away to the square leg boundary.</i>

1806
02:11:50,204 --> 02:11:52,499
<i>Oh, it's in the air. Logie misses it.</i>

1807
02:11:52,624 --> 02:11:55,588
<i>Luck is going India's way.
Almost got him that time.</i>

1808
02:11:55,708 --> 02:11:56,624
<i>In the air again.</i>

1809
02:11:56,744 --> 02:11:57,666
<i>From the meat of the bat.</i>

1810
02:11:57,791 --> 02:11:59,997
<i>Screams away towards the pavilion
for a four.</i>

1811
02:12:01,374 --> 02:12:05,004
<i>Quick inswinger from Marshall
hits straight on the pads. It's out!</i>

1812
02:12:05,124 --> 02:12:06,791
<i>The second big blow for India.</i>

1813
02:12:06,958 --> 02:12:10,478
<i>Short but enterprising innings
comes to an end.</i>

1814
02:12:10,598 --> 02:12:14,469
<i>38 runs including a 6 and 7 fours.</i>

1815
02:12:22,666 --> 02:12:24,900
<i>Magnificent shot by Amarnath.</i>

1816
02:12:30,883 --> 02:12:35,724
<i>Clean bowled. Beautiful ball!
Amarnath is out at 26.</i>

1817
02:12:36,124 --> 02:12:39,470
<i>India now 90 for 3
in the 30th over.</i>

1818
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:43,415
<i>Half the match over and the
run rate at just 3 per over.</i>

1819
02:12:45,041 --> 02:12:48,788
<i>Gomes to Yashpal. In the air</i>

1820
02:12:49,783 --> 02:12:52,340
<i>and caught by the substitute Logie.</i>

1821
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:53,956
<i>Something of a tragedy for India.</i>

1822
02:12:54,076 --> 02:12:57,448
<i>Losing two wickets in quick succession.
92 for 4 now.</i>

1823
02:12:57,568 --> 02:12:59,362
India in trouble.

1824
02:13:08,561 --> 02:13:13,201
<i>And here comes Kapil Dev,
the last remaining hope for India.</i>

1825
02:13:16,957 --> 02:13:19,647
Kapil Dev!

1826
02:13:21,096 --> 02:13:23,094
Come on, Viv.

1827
02:13:23,214 --> 02:13:28,527
<i>Richards to Kapil..
Hits strongly for 4.</i>

1828
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:36,007
<i>Another smash hit from
the Haryana Hurricane!</i>

1829
02:13:36,248 --> 02:13:40,897
<i>Kapil knows India needs
to take charge right now.</i>

1830
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:51,272
<i>That's 15 runs from just 8 balls.</i>

1831
02:13:51,397 --> 02:13:55,360
<i>For Kapil after Tunbridge Wells
anything is possible when he's around.</i>

1832
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:58,621
<i>Kapil swings at another one
and it's gone high in the air</i>

1833
02:13:58,741 --> 02:14:00,818
<i>towards the long on boundary.</i>

1834
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,368
Catch it.

1835
02:14:06,287 --> 02:14:08,377
<i>Looks like it's going to be a six.</i>

1836
02:14:16,936 --> 02:14:19,736
<i>That's a tragedy as far as
India is concerned.</i>

1837
02:14:19,856 --> 02:14:24,158
<i>Gomes has picked up the vital wicket
of the Indian Captain.</i>

1838
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:34,086
<i>Roberts to Azad.</i>

1839
02:14:34,277 --> 02:14:35,818
Catch it.

1840
02:14:36,308 --> 02:14:38,159
<i>Kirti Azad is out without scoring.</i>

1841
02:14:38,279 --> 02:14:42,405
<i>India are now 6 down for 111
and in an awful lot of trouble.</i>

1842
02:14:43,614 --> 02:14:44,819
<i>Binny goes for two.</i>

1843
02:14:44,939 --> 02:14:47,861
<i>This is definitely a big
blow for India. Two quick wickets.</i>

1844
02:14:47,981 --> 02:14:51,590
<i>India now sinks deeper
at 130 for 7.</i>

1845
02:14:52,518 --> 02:14:56,252
<i>Patil goes down on his knees and
thumps it for 6 at square leg.</i>

1846
02:15:02,741 --> 02:15:04,465
<i>3 more runs for Patil.</i>

1847
02:15:04,585 --> 02:15:06,499
<i>Every run is vital for India.</i>

1848
02:15:07,914 --> 02:15:11,679
<i>Madan Lal has hit that
for a big six.</i>

1849
02:15:11,799 --> 02:15:14,240
Catch it.

1850
02:15:17,258 --> 02:15:19,613
<i>That's in the air
and that's got to be out.</i>

1851
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:24,151
<i>And yes! Larry Gomes at mid-on
makes no mistake with that one.</i>

1852
02:15:29,039 --> 02:15:32,360
<i>Oh, that was a fast one from Marshall.</i>

1853
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:35,086
<i>The West Indies are loving every moment.</i>

1854
02:15:35,206 --> 02:15:35,760
Ballu!

1855
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:39,816
<i>That was a bit of their magical
pace they would say.</i>

1856
02:15:40,054 --> 02:15:43,987
- <i>India are now 161 for 9.</i>
- Ballu.

1857
02:15:44,205 --> 02:15:46,152
<i>Just one wicket left.</i>

1858
02:15:46,472 --> 02:15:49,189
<i>Is it all over for India now?</i>

1859
02:15:58,367 --> 02:16:01,704
<i>Ballu, no matter what's going on
in our lives</i>

1860
02:16:02,781 --> 02:16:06,444
when we walk onto the pitch
in our uniforms

1861
02:16:07,453 --> 02:16:09,181
we have only one purpose.

1862
02:16:15,597 --> 02:16:18,806
To play for our country
with all our hearts.

1863
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:26,902
Whatever might be happening
for us personally -

1864
02:16:27,027 --> 02:16:28,575
no one knows or cares.

1865
02:16:28,744 --> 02:16:32,272
<i>But what we achieve
on this ground today</i>

1866
02:16:33,032 --> 02:16:37,152
will be linked to our names forever.

1867
02:16:38,567 --> 02:16:42,236
This day will never return.

1868
02:16:45,225 --> 02:16:47,165
Hammer them.

1869
02:17:19,705 --> 02:17:21,194
Ballu, are you all right?

1870
02:17:21,505 --> 02:17:22,986
Are you OK?

1871
02:17:25,036 --> 02:17:27,374
You don't bowl bouncers
at number ten.

1872
02:17:27,494 --> 02:17:29,047
I won't have it.

1873
02:17:32,805 --> 02:17:36,375
<i>Wins and losses should show
only on the scoreboard</i>

1874
02:17:36,856 --> 02:17:38,836
<i>not in our eyes.</i>

1875
02:17:41,902 --> 02:17:46,255
<i>Oh, well struck. Sandhu stands his ground
and hits Marshall towards mid on.</i>

1876
02:17:46,788 --> 02:17:49,736
<i>These two putting on
invaluable runs for India.</i>

1877
02:17:49,856 --> 02:17:53,621
<i>India now at 183 for 9.</i>

1878
02:18:01,917 --> 02:18:04,887
<i>Bowled him...it's all over.</i>

1879
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:06,496
<i>That's the end.</i>

1880
02:18:06,616 --> 02:18:09,325
<i>Very gallant batting by the
last two Indian batsmen.</i>

1881
02:18:09,445 --> 02:18:12,971
<i>They put on 22 more runs
when it all seemed to be over.</i>

1882
02:18:13,091 --> 02:18:15,202
<i>Sandhu remains unbeaten on 11</i>

1883
02:18:15,322 --> 02:18:20,817
<i>and India are all out for
183 in just 54 overs.</i>

1884
02:18:21,047 --> 02:18:24,016
Sit down. Come on, sit down!

1885
02:18:24,136 --> 02:18:28,080
<i>In limited overs cricket, being bowled
out in less than the available overs</i>

1886
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:32,280
<i>is a matter of great shame,
especially in a World Cup Final.</i>

1887
02:18:40,320 --> 02:18:43,917
I hear whistling in my ear.
I was hit just below the ear.

1888
02:18:44,181 --> 02:18:47,057
It felt like all the slaps I got
at school had landed in one go.

1889
02:18:49,008 --> 02:18:50,837
No, it's the truth!

1890
02:18:53,278 --> 02:18:54,974
Here. Take this.

1891
02:18:57,774 --> 02:18:59,028
You'll be fine.

1892
02:18:59,148 --> 02:19:00,943
Well done, it's OK.

1893
02:19:01,317 --> 02:19:02,691
Get ready to bowl.

1894
02:19:03,191 --> 02:19:08,321
<i>183 is the lowest score ever
in a World Cup Final.</i>

1895
02:19:09,025 --> 02:19:12,124
<i>Had it been England, we could've
called it a Final.</i>

1896
02:19:12,365 --> 02:19:14,608
<i>At least we would've had
an interesting match.</i>

1897
02:19:14,900 --> 02:19:18,191
Come on. Come on, soldiers.
Let's fight!

1898
02:19:18,941 --> 02:19:21,821
Let them say they were batting
better than us.

1899
02:19:21,941 --> 02:19:24,522
Bowling and fielding better
than us. It's OK.

1900
02:19:24,642 --> 02:19:28,608
They just shouldn't say they were
trying harder than us.

1901
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:33,632
I know we didn't get a high score.
But we did score.

1902
02:19:34,457 --> 02:19:37,738
And they have yet to score 183 runs.

1903
02:19:37,858 --> 02:19:40,941
We won't let that happen.
Come what may.

1904
02:19:44,108 --> 02:19:45,900
The game boils down to that.

1905
02:19:49,771 --> 02:19:53,025
Hey guys, this is your first
World Cup Final, so smile!

1906
02:19:55,286 --> 02:19:57,469
Come on, smile.

1907
02:20:07,508 --> 02:20:11,525
What we do here today
is that everybody fight.

1908
02:20:11,650 --> 02:20:14,400
Fight for our life
and we will do that.

1909
02:20:14,992 --> 02:20:17,400
Because like people says

1910
02:20:24,442 --> 02:20:26,816
Taste the success once...

1911
02:20:29,191 --> 02:20:31,473
Taste success once...

1912
02:20:31,652 --> 02:20:33,983
tongue wants more!

1913
02:20:34,279 --> 02:20:37,003
Here, catch! Make sure you catch
on the field too.

1914
02:20:37,291 --> 02:20:38,821
You don't give me an option only.

1915
02:20:38,941 --> 02:20:41,025
You laugh when I speak English.

1916
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:45,066
183 is enough

1917
02:20:47,277 --> 02:20:51,179
if we fight for every run.

1918
02:21:20,441 --> 02:21:23,066
<i>The West Indies fans dancing
to the calypso beat.</i>

1919
02:21:23,191 --> 02:21:26,269
<i>They'll be hoping it's a repeat
of the semi-finals against Pakistan</i>

1920
02:21:26,389 --> 02:21:30,968
<i>where they chased down 184
with 8 wickets to spare.</i>

1921
02:21:35,066 --> 02:21:37,150
<i>The first over by the Captain
is a maiden.</i>

1922
02:21:37,275 --> 02:21:39,821
<i>Looks like the Indians will fight
for every run.</i>

1923
02:21:39,941 --> 02:21:41,400
<i>Sandhu to Greenidge.</i>

1924
02:21:41,785 --> 02:21:43,667
<i>And that outswinger
almost finding the edge.</i>

1925
02:21:43,787 --> 02:21:45,092
Ballu!

1926
02:21:46,329 --> 02:21:47,572
Play your inswinger.

1927
02:21:48,348 --> 02:21:50,499
And listen, hide it!

1928
02:21:53,412 --> 02:21:55,663
<i>An extra man on the
off side for Sandhu.</i>

1929
02:22:09,774 --> 02:22:12,316
<i>And he's bowled him!
Would you believe it?</i>

1930
02:22:12,483 --> 02:22:13,679
<i>What a ball!</i>

1931
02:22:13,858 --> 02:22:18,647
<i>It looked like it would go out but
the ball cut back in quite sharply.</i>

1932
02:22:18,858 --> 02:22:22,358
<i>Sandhu has managed to fool a man
of Gordon Greenidge's experience.</i>

1933
02:22:22,478 --> 02:22:26,244
<i>An early breakthrough for India.
West Indies are 5 for 1.</i>

1934
02:22:27,681 --> 02:22:29,762
<i>And in comes Viv Richards.</i>

1935
02:22:29,882 --> 02:22:33,321
<i>And he's been in smashing form with three
man of the match award in four games.</i>

1936
02:22:33,441 --> 02:22:35,316
He's arrived. Keep it tight, Sardar.

1937
02:22:35,483 --> 02:22:38,509
You'll get him out too. Come on.

1938
02:22:39,608 --> 02:22:42,025
You said something to him,
I was watching.

1939
02:22:42,145 --> 02:22:44,214
Kaps, what medicine did you
give Ballu?

1940
02:22:45,032 --> 02:22:46,233
Vitamin C.

1941
02:22:48,323 --> 02:22:50,783
- Keep at it, Sardar.
- Come on, Ballu.

1942
02:23:00,276 --> 02:23:01,905
<i>Sandhu to Richards.</i>

1943
02:23:02,379 --> 02:23:06,333
<i>Pulled away powerfully. Four runs.
No problem. That's Richards.</i>

1944
02:23:10,144 --> 02:23:13,286
<i>Richards does make this look
awfully easy. Superbly timed.</i>

1945
02:23:17,257 --> 02:23:19,972
<i>Kapil to Richards.
And it's another boundary.</i>

1946
02:23:20,092 --> 02:23:23,143
<i>Pakistan made 184 in the semi-final.</i>

1947
02:23:23,263 --> 02:23:26,247
<i>That is one more run
than India's total today.</i>

1948
02:23:26,367 --> 02:23:30,575
<i>While Viv has made 80 runs
with 11 fours and one sixer.</i>

1949
02:23:30,695 --> 02:23:33,071
<i>Single-handedly winning the match
for his team.</i>

1950
02:23:33,191 --> 02:23:35,066
Viv is going to kill you.

1951
02:23:35,311 --> 02:23:37,273
He's going to eat you up!

1952
02:23:37,393 --> 02:23:39,879
<i>That's probably what he has in mind.</i>

1953
02:24:12,108 --> 02:24:15,864
<i>Beautiful drive! Madan Lal gets
the same treatment.</i>

1954
02:24:37,443 --> 02:24:39,795
<i>That's the third four.</i>

1955
02:24:41,694 --> 02:24:44,610
<i>The match is slipping away
from the Indians.</i>

1956
02:24:47,002 --> 02:24:49,182
How has it happened?

1957
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:54,215
What's this nonsense?
Let's go.

1958
02:25:00,774 --> 02:25:03,661
He hit Madan for three fours
in one over.

1959
02:25:04,376 --> 02:25:06,466
I can't bear to watch.

1960
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:10,610
<i>Kapil might want to change things
around after that last Madan Lal over.</i>

1961
02:25:10,730 --> 02:25:13,733
<i>Viv had 33 from just 27 balls.</i>

1962
02:25:13,858 --> 02:25:15,776
Kapil, give me another over.

1963
02:25:15,896 --> 02:25:17,592
No, Madipaa. You'd better rest.

1964
02:25:17,712 --> 02:25:19,686
Kapil, I've set him.
Give me one more over.

1965
02:25:20,424 --> 02:25:22,142
No, he'll give you a hammering.

1966
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:25,813
Kapil, he has it in for me.

1967
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:28,483
He's batting like it's a match
of 30 overs.

1968
02:25:28,716 --> 02:25:31,449
He's overconfident. I'll take
advantage of that. Give me an over.

1969
02:25:31,569 --> 02:25:33,446
No, Madipaa. It's too risky.

1970
02:25:35,251 --> 02:25:37,316
He doesn't believe
I'm a bowler, Kaps.

1971
02:25:37,492 --> 02:25:40,621
Give me an over.
I want to show him.

1972
02:25:46,306 --> 02:25:47,777
Just one over, Kaps.

1973
02:25:51,627 --> 02:25:53,607
Ballu.

1974
02:25:58,444 --> 02:26:00,818
<i>Madan Lal is given another over.</i>

1975
02:26:02,201 --> 02:26:04,519
<i>The Captain is taking a big risk.</i>

1976
02:26:24,694 --> 02:26:27,989
Stop, Yash, stop!

1977
02:26:56,048 --> 02:26:59,164
<i>Richards has hit that away to
within 15 yards of the boundary</i>

1978
02:26:59,284 --> 02:27:03,147
<i>and the Indian skipper has done
a tremendous job to run back there.</i>

1979
02:27:03,267 --> 02:27:06,678
<i>Marvellous running catch.
One of the finest ever taken.</i>

1980
02:27:10,225 --> 02:27:14,115
<i>This was the wicket India desperately
needed to stay in the game.</i>

1981
02:27:14,235 --> 02:27:17,486
<i>Richards departs for 33 runs.</i>

1982
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:24,131
Ladies, ladies.
Where are your passes?

1983
02:27:25,079 --> 02:27:26,608
We threw them away.

1984
02:27:26,785 --> 02:27:29,233
We thought we were losing but
now we want to go back inside.

1985
02:27:29,411 --> 02:27:31,483
Sorry, ladies. No entry without
a pass.

1986
02:27:32,224 --> 02:27:34,060
<i>Madan Lal to Lloyd.</i>

1987
02:27:38,535 --> 02:27:42,090
<i>That doesn't look good.
The West Indies Captain is limping.</i>

1988
02:27:42,210 --> 02:27:43,530
Can I have a runner, please?

1989
02:27:43,728 --> 02:27:45,095
Please. Please, we must go inside.

1990
02:27:45,215 --> 02:27:46,387
I'm Kapil Dev's wife.

1991
02:27:46,552 --> 02:27:48,605
Yes, sure, and I'm
the King of England!

1992
02:27:48,725 --> 02:27:50,306
Ladies, please step aside.

1993
02:27:54,248 --> 02:27:56,108
<i>Madan Lal gets another one!</i>

1994
02:27:56,233 --> 02:27:59,307
<i>This is tremendous from India.
Absolutely fantastic.</i>

1995
02:27:59,427 --> 02:28:01,178
Ladies, please.

1996
02:28:01,768 --> 02:28:03,660
Let's watch it on TV.

1997
02:28:05,064 --> 02:28:07,347
- Is it working?
- No!

1998
02:28:07,580 --> 02:28:09,663
- Now?
- No!

1999
02:28:10,208 --> 02:28:12,775
- Has it come now?
- Turn it properly.

2000
02:28:13,411 --> 02:28:14,641
What do you mean? No signal?

2001
02:28:14,761 --> 02:28:16,478
Someone, pick up the phone.

2002
02:28:16,754 --> 02:28:18,150
We're trying our best.

2003
02:28:18,275 --> 02:28:19,825
Our lives depend on this and
you've lost the signal.

2004
02:28:19,945 --> 02:28:22,091
No one disrupted the signal
on purpose.

2005
02:28:22,211 --> 02:28:24,250
When will it come back?
When the match is over?

2006
02:28:24,929 --> 02:28:27,816
Hello! Hey mister.
Hello!

2007
02:28:28,241 --> 02:28:30,150
His leg's hurting him.

2008
02:28:30,586 --> 02:28:32,916
Force him to come forward and play.

2009
02:28:34,196 --> 02:28:36,026
<i>Binny comes back into the attack.</i>

2010
02:28:36,146 --> 02:28:38,353
It's come.

2011
02:28:41,677 --> 02:28:44,991
<i>Binny bowling to Lloyd.</i>

2012
02:28:47,281 --> 02:28:51,472
<i>And he's out! The West Indian Captain
is caught by the Indian Captain.</i>

2013
02:28:51,673 --> 02:28:52,654
<i>Big wicket!</i>

2014
02:28:52,858 --> 02:28:57,306
<i>Binny's 18th wicket, making him the
highest wicket taker of the tournament.</i>

2015
02:28:59,634 --> 02:29:01,851
Mother!

2016
02:29:07,332 --> 02:29:10,572
<i>He's gone. What a magnificent
catch by Kirmani.</i>

2017
02:29:10,692 --> 02:29:15,034
At 76 for 6, the reigning world
champions are in total disarray.

2018
02:29:20,098 --> 02:29:23,063
Now dance. Now show us your dancing.

2019
02:29:23,183 --> 02:29:25,669
Kapil's going to kill you.

2020
02:29:29,706 --> 02:29:31,730
<i>A low flat six from Dujon.</i>

2021
02:29:32,864 --> 02:29:35,412
<i>The Indians cannot
get complacent now.</i>

2022
02:29:36,025 --> 02:29:39,108
Sardar, keep the ball tight.
It mustn't go for a boundary.

2023
02:29:39,228 --> 02:29:43,091
I've set the fielding. There, there
and there. Come on.

2024
02:29:43,306 --> 02:29:45,376
Where, where and where?

2025
02:29:45,794 --> 02:29:47,316
You think this is a joke?

2026
02:29:47,436 --> 02:29:49,185
Sardar, it's the Final.
Get serious.

2027
02:29:49,643 --> 02:29:52,771
Brother, whatever you say.

2028
02:29:59,901 --> 02:30:01,575
<i>Crucial juncture in the game.</i>

2029
02:30:01,695 --> 02:30:05,298
<i>With that single,
West Indies brings up their 100.</i>

2030
02:30:09,630 --> 02:30:11,652
<i>Yashpal cannot stop that.</i>

2031
02:30:14,292 --> 02:30:15,908
Ballu!

2032
02:30:16,355 --> 02:30:21,025
<i>The required run rate is still
just over 3 runs per over.</i>

2033
02:30:21,223 --> 02:30:24,463
<i>Will Dujon save the game
for the West Indies?</i>

2034
02:30:24,583 --> 02:30:27,775
<i>The West Indies now need 65 runs
in 19 overs to win the World Cup.</i>

2035
02:30:27,895 --> 02:30:28,650
Jimpa...

2036
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:31,380
<i>India needs a crucial wicket now.</i>

2037
02:30:31,658 --> 02:30:33,862
Make Lala-ji 10 years younger today.

2038
02:30:42,288 --> 02:30:45,483
<i>Kapil turns to his
most trusted teammate.</i>

2039
02:30:47,006 --> 02:30:50,191
<i>Jimmy to Dujon. And he's bowled!</i>

2040
02:30:50,311 --> 02:30:54,606
<i>Jimmy has proven his worth
time and time again.</i>

2041
02:30:54,726 --> 02:30:57,983
Dujon is out. Amarnath has taken
a crucial wicket.

2042
02:30:58,108 --> 02:31:02,260
<i>India is now back in the game
and it's wide open.</i>

2043
02:31:10,547 --> 02:31:12,285
<i>And that's another wicket
by Amarnath.</i>

2044
02:31:12,405 --> 02:31:14,578
<i>After a fabulous performance in the
semi-finals,</i>

2045
02:31:14,698 --> 02:31:17,555
<i>Amarnath is now turning
the tide in the Final.</i>

2046
02:31:17,967 --> 02:31:20,433
Howzzat!

2047
02:31:23,771 --> 02:31:25,525
<i>Kapil Dev gets another one!</i>

2048
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:28,722
<i>India so close to
making history now.</i>

2049
02:31:32,012 --> 02:31:33,441
What happened?

2050
02:31:33,566 --> 02:31:35,316
- What's the score?
- The score?

2051
02:31:35,436 --> 02:31:39,221
- 9 wickets down.
- Wow! 9 wickets down.

2052
02:31:43,199 --> 02:31:45,900
<i>The West Indies now 9 wickets down.</i>

2053
02:31:46,025 --> 02:31:48,007
<i>Jimmy to Holding.</i>

2054
02:31:49,195 --> 02:31:51,966
Howzat!

2055
02:32:19,551 --> 02:32:21,498
Out!

2056
02:33:03,715 --> 02:33:08,008
<i>Steeped in your love,
O beloved country</i>

2057
02:33:08,217 --> 02:33:12,652
<i>Every trial is effortless</i>

2058
02:33:12,772 --> 02:33:21,718
<i>Together your admirers have
conquered the sky</i>

2059
02:33:21,942 --> 02:33:26,271
<i>Steeped in your love,
O beloved country</i>

2060
02:33:26,391 --> 02:33:30,912
<i>Every task is possible</i>

2061
02:33:31,032 --> 02:33:39,567
<i>Your admirers have won over
the world.</i>

2062
02:33:39,687 --> 02:33:48,036
<i>As long as there's life
in our breath</i>

2063
02:33:48,315 --> 02:33:55,556
<i>Devoted in our love for you,
O beloved country</i>

2064
02:33:55,984 --> 02:33:58,616
India has won the World Cup!

2065
02:33:58,939 --> 02:34:01,969
<i>Let our flag fly high!</i>

2066
02:34:02,089 --> 02:34:05,888
<i>Let our flag fly high!</i>

2067
02:34:50,428 --> 02:34:51,527
Kapil!

2068
02:34:52,847 --> 02:34:54,599
Kapil!

2069
02:34:54,792 --> 02:34:57,960
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
India has won the cricket World Cup.</i>

2070
02:35:03,839 --> 02:35:06,608
This shows that we can do it.

2071
02:35:06,789 --> 02:35:08,421
Brother.

2072
02:35:08,541 --> 02:35:11,716
One day, I'll play cricket
for India too.

2073
02:35:11,836 --> 02:35:14,008
Yes.

2074
02:35:15,142 --> 02:35:20,781
<i>Name and glory,
O beloved country</i>

2075
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:27,244
<i>Points to none other than you</i>

2076
02:35:27,364 --> 02:35:34,436
<i>Wherever I go, I long for you</i>

2077
02:35:34,705 --> 02:35:39,937
<i>Your name will shine for ever more</i>

2078
02:36:32,722 --> 02:36:35,743
No one slept that night.

2079
02:36:36,544 --> 02:36:40,860
People were dancing everywhere, from
the streets into the hotel lobby.

2080
02:36:41,153 --> 02:36:45,339
I can't find the words to describe
that visual.

2081
02:36:45,828 --> 02:36:50,840
People were dancing and singing
and beating drums!

2082
02:36:50,960 --> 02:36:54,290
That kind of happiness was not
something we had experienced...

2083
02:36:54,575 --> 02:36:56,507
I definitely hadn't.

2084
02:36:56,860 --> 02:37:00,933
Champagne bottles were popped
every minute as people celebrated.

2085
02:37:01,053 --> 02:37:04,937
But I was just worried about who
was going to pay for all this.

2086
02:37:05,057 --> 02:37:09,251
It was the last day of the tour,
no one had any money left.

2087
02:37:09,633 --> 02:37:12,876
I still do not know to this day
who paid for everything.

2088
02:37:13,255 --> 02:37:15,514
We couldn't eat, we were so happy.

2089
02:37:15,634 --> 02:37:19,658
By the time we got hungry,
all the restaurants had closed.

2090
02:37:19,908 --> 02:37:21,914
The day we won the World Cup,

2091
02:37:22,034 --> 02:37:26,401
we slept on an empty stomach,
but with a full heart.

2092
02:37:26,521 --> 02:37:28,513
When we first got to England,

2093
02:37:28,633 --> 02:37:31,609
the famous cricket journalist,
David Frith

2094
02:37:31,921 --> 02:37:34,239
had written in an article

2095
02:37:34,462 --> 02:37:37,300
that if India won,
'he'd eat his words'.

2096
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:40,063
Meaning he would chew up his words.

2097
02:37:40,544 --> 02:37:42,585
After we won on the 25th June,1983,

2098
02:37:42,705 --> 02:37:45,329
there were massive celebrations.

2099
02:37:45,628 --> 02:37:48,172
I only managed to get back
to my room at 4 am.

2100
02:37:48,734 --> 02:37:53,057
As soon as I sat down
I wrote a letter to David.

2101
02:37:53,286 --> 02:37:57,632
'Mr Frith, now that we've won,
you'll have to eat your words!'

2102
02:37:57,899 --> 02:38:02,179
A month later, on 23 July
David Frith went to Lord's.

2103
02:38:02,404 --> 02:38:05,316
He had a glass of wine in his hands,

2104
02:38:05,436 --> 02:38:08,467
and he chewed up the article
he had written!

2105
02:38:08,587 --> 02:38:14,777
<i>Sitting with folded hands
achieves nothing</i>

2106
02:38:14,897 --> 02:38:20,442
<i>Go, show fate what it means
to have strength of purpose</i>

2107
02:38:20,562 --> 02:38:26,117
<i>If you are brave, my fellow country-
men God is on your side too</i>

2108
02:38:26,237 --> 02:38:31,745
<i>Go, show the world what it means
to believe in yourself</i>

2109
02:38:31,943 --> 02:38:37,487
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

2110
02:38:37,607 --> 02:38:42,567
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

2111
02:38:42,687 --> 02:38:48,291
<i>Let it fly on high</i>

2112
02:38:48,411 --> 02:38:53,783
<i>Proudly wave your country's flag</i>

2113
02:39:16,841 --> 02:39:19,756
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

2114
02:39:19,876 --> 02:39:22,289
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

2115
02:39:22,494 --> 02:39:28,478
<i>Proudly wave your country's flag</i>
