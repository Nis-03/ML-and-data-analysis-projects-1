1
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,520
"Every rural home in
India has the same story."

2
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,840
"Farmers sell their land,"

3
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,040
"and do farming on their
own land for someone else."

4
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,240
"Or guard it."

5
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,520
"Or leave the village
and head for the city."

6
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,080
"This story is about
Dutta Pehelwan (wrestler),"

7
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,240
"and his son Rahul."

8
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
The bloody watchman's asleep!

9
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,480
Wake him up!

10
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,280
Coming, sir!

11
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,600
Watch out on the other side.

12
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,960
You're too close to the gate.

13
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,480
Stop. Stop. Stop.

14
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,000
The gate was swinging...

15
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,800
What have you done?

16
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,800
Beat him.

17
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
Rahul, that Shinder builder
is thrashing your father!

18
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Come Ganya,
we'll have to teach him a lesson.

19
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,320
Wait, Rahul. I am coming.

20
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
181...

21
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,600
182...

22
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,920
Faster. You need to complete 200.

23
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,840
What are you doing, Shinde?

24
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,080
This is not the way.

25
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,640
Look at the Mercedes.

26
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,600
There's no way you
can pay for the damage.

27
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,400
Don't show off your wealth, Shinde.

28
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,240
Don't you forget,
this land once belonged to us...

29
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,480
which I bought in cash.

30
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,200
We all know at what price.

31
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,640
Leave it, Rahul. It was my fault.

32
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,000
Take him away.

33
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,960
Let's go.

34
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,480
Don't give me the stare,
cheapskate. Get lost.

35
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,160
What did you get
by selling the land?

36
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,520
Grand wedding for your daughter!

37
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,360
Cars, money,
jewellery for her in-laws!

38
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,920
So everyone can be awed
by the great 'Dutta wedding'.

39
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
Unfortunately, no one was.

40
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,120
But three months later
when she returned home,

41
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,440
everyone said Dutta
Pehelwan's lost his pride.

42
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,480
Spent more than he could afford
on his daughter's wedding.

43
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,840
Rahulya, you have a sharp tongue.

44
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,800
Put your energy to some good use,

45
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,320
so we can make ends meet.

46
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,840
Let the one who sold
the land earn a living.

47
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,640
Seriously?

48
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,520
And what about you?

49
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,160
You'll insult him and eat for free.

50
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,320
Rahul, finish your food!

51
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,200
Feed it to the dogs.

52
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,520
You lose your temper
on petty things.

53
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,440
I don't know anything
except for farming.

54
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,960
Quit school in class 8.

55
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,400
I quit school, you were dismissed.

56
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,920
For hitting on the
teacher's daughter.

57
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
I wasn't hitting on her.

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,160
I loved her.

59
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,000
- That's why he scr...
- Hey Rahulya, Ganya.

60
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,160
Uncle Uday!

61
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,800
What are you doing out here?

62
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,400
Arun you too.

63
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,520
Yeah, I brought him along too.

64
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,240
What are you doing?
Take the carrier home.

65
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,680
I got him in a college in Pune.

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,280
Why?

67
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,920
Because now I'm here for good.

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,720
I'm done with Mumbai.

69
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,160
What's up, uncle?

70
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,160
I got transferred to the
Market yard police station.

71
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,480
- Do you want to hear the entire story?
- See you later.

72
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,320
See you.

73
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,000
See you uncle, aunt.

74
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,320
What's wrong?
Why is everyone so depressed?

75
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,560
Shinde fired your
father from the job.

76
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,200
Why?

77
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,640
He getting vegetables,

78
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
from our field.

79
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Our field, father? Ours?

80
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,920
Enough, Rahul. Stop it.

81
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,720
Why did he fire you if you were
getting vegetables from our field?

82
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,600
Shinde said he was stealing
and threw him out.

83
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,160
What now?

84
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Tarde... he's found him another job,

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,240
in Pune's Market yard.

86
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,840
What job at the market yard?

87
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,320
Labour.

88
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,160
Good going, father.

89
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,760
Needs a lot of strength
but no courage.

90
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,120
And you're a wrestler.

91
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
- Stop I said.
- What happened?

92
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,880
Where are you going?

93
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,680
- Rahul.
- Rahul.

94
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,640
Rahul, stop.

95
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,400
Shinde.

96
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,240
Rahul.

97
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,200
Rahul, stop.

98
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,240
Shinde.

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
What happened?
Why are you screaming?

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,880
You threw my father out of his job.

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,560
I don't entertain thieves
who steal at my place.

102
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,400
How much was he taking?

103
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,200
He's donated more vegetables
than you can count in a lifetime.

104
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,200
Get lost or I will
have you thrown out!

105
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,880
- Shinde...
- Rahul.

106
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,360
I am a son of a farmer,

107
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,120
and I swear on my mother.

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,560
One day I'll make you toil
on this field with a pair of bulls!

109
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,120
- Get lost.
- Like a plough.

110
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,640
Get lost.

111
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,520
- You don't ever listen to me, father.
- Come on.

112
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,280
Sit down quietly.

113
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,320
He'll have me thrown out.

114
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,440
He'll have us thrown out.

115
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,240
Sit down.

116
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,200
Sit down and keep calm.

117
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Your temper will someday...

118
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,720
Rahul!

119
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,240
- Stop screaming, drama queen.
- Stop the truck.

120
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,480
Stop the truck.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,720
Father dearest,
can he come with us too?

122
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,200
You always take things lightly.

123
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
Catch my bag.

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
- Sit here.
- Let's go.

125
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
He said and you tagged along.

126
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,920
Where are you going?

127
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,160
All thanks to Shinde Builder,
understand.

128
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,360
Leaving me alone.

129
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,000
"The world's a evil place."

130
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,680
"Filled with evil thoughts."

131
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
"Has run after,"

132
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,800
"dirty profession fast."

133
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,440
"Someone will come along,"

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,120
"in place of God."

135
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,280
"A girl's been raped
in a garage in Ganesh Nagar."

136
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,960
"Even the Police & local residents
are scared to help."

137
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
- "Why are you recording this?"
- "Wait."

138
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,960
- "We'll get in trouble."
- "We'll be viral."

139
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,680
- "Let's get out of here."
- "Okay, fine."

140
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,720
Come on.

141
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,480
Did anyone see anything?

142
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
No one saw anything.

143
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,560
Someone made a video, posted it too,

144
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,280
but no one saw anything.

145
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,720
What if it was your
daughter or sister instead?

146
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,000
Would you still be making
videos and posting them?

147
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,480
You should be ashamed!

148
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
Who are you scared of?

149
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
Who are you terrorized by?

150
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
Sir, I saw them.

151
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,240
Sir, it was the local MLA's son.

152
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,080
I saw it with my own eyes.

153
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
He's done it with another girl.

154
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,200
The girl's brother
made a Police complaint,

155
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,760
and they killed him.

156
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,040
They are all animals.

157
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Where does he stay?

158
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,080
That building.

159
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
See who's at the door.

160
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Why did you come inside, Sardar?

161
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,440
- So I can arrest you.
- Why?

162
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,040
Because of what you
did with that girl.

163
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,680
There's no witness or testimony.

164
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,120
Think you can still arrest me?

165
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
Not yet,

166
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,480
but there will be.

167
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,320
My belt alone can
teach you a lesson.

168
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,920
You were terrorized of him,
weren't you?

169
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,800
Will you testify now?

170
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,200
I will testify, sir.

171
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,640
I will testify, sir.

172
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,760
I will testify.

173
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,920
- We'll testify!
- We'll testify! We'll testify!

174
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,040
Rahul.

175
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,760
What happened, Rahul?
Where were you looking?

176
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,240
This sack was lying in the middle.

177
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,280
It's not the sack,
it's the tea-seller.

178
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,480
I've been noticing for
the last couple of days,

179
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,200
you've had your eyes on her.

180
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,440
I've lost my heart to her.

181
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,640
She won't fall for you.

182
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,080
I'll impress her.

183
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,000
Leave it.

184
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
- Do you want to see?
- Yes.

185
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,720
What are you doing?

186
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,440
What?

187
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,920
One special tea.

188
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,960
Learn to say it first.

189
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,160
You teach me.

190
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,440
It's called 'special tea'.

191
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,960
Costs three rupees.

192
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,960
But you should stick
to regular one rupee tea.

193
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,120
That's what all labours here drink.

194
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,120
Then I will have the special one.

195
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,160
Because I'm special too.

196
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,400
Here are three rupees.

197
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,680
Here. Your tea.

198
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,640
How can you prove
this tea's special?

199
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,280
Everyone take's Manda's word for it.
Understood.

200
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,360
Then you taste it first
and then I'll be convinced.

201
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,080
Listen, you over smart freak,
look around you.

202
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,560
I'm the only female in this
man's world running this tea shop.

203
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,120
No one's dared to
even lay a finger on me.

204
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
And what do you think?

205
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,560
You can impress me
with your filmy one-liners.

206
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,040
Have your tea or get lost.

207
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,520
Smart alec.

208
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,040
Someday you'll offer this
freak this special tea,

209
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,000
after you've tasted it.

210
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,120
Let's go, Ganya.

211
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,640
Take your money.

212
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,560
Keep it.
As a credit for that special tea.

213
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,080
She's got a temper.

214
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,560
Where were you guys?

215
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,800
Having tea, father.

216
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,600
- Bring these sacks along.
- Okay.

217
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,720
Come, Rahul. Give me a hand.

218
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,880
What's he doing here?

219
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,040
Who?

220
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,840
From a pro wrestler
to ordinary labour.

221
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,280
Do you know him?

222
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,560
Know him?

223
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,360
He was the reigning
Maharashtra Kesari.

224
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,720
Absurd.

225
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,080
Honestly.

226
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,240
I gave him 5000
rupees with a trophy.

227
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,400
Careful.

228
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,000
Now he's sold everything
and reduced to dust.

229
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,280
Time to get paid!

230
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,880
So tired of working all day.

231
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,080
Let's collect salary.

232
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,680
Come on.

233
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,880
Pay up.

234
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,080
Come on, keep moving.

235
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,080
What is this?
What's the queue all about?

236
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,640
- It's the Corporator's share.
- Why?

237
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,880
No money no jobs.

238
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,880
But this is wrong.

239
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,880
We'll have to pay.

240
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,000
Here I come, my beloved bar...

241
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,440
Hey cheapskate, where do
you think you're going? Come here.

242
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,880
We've had enough of you wise guy.
Come here.

243
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,280
Don't touch my collar.

244
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,320
Stop blabbering and pay up.

245
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,040
Pay up.

246
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,760
- I said don't touch me.
- How dare you hit me?

247
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,280
Don't hit me.

248
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,200
- What are they doing?
- Why are you beating him? Leave him!

249
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,480
Leave my father alone!
Father, get up.

250
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
They are beating up a poor man
and everyone's watching.

251
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,560
Get lost.
Your father's had it coming.

252
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,840
Father, get up.

253
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,640
Ganya, let's go.

254
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
How dare you refuse us?

255
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,680
What are you doing?

256
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,480
Stop it, guys.
You've roughed him up enough.

257
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,120
Get lost, ass****

258
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,040
Don't abuse.

259
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,800
Or what? What will you do?

260
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,680
Don't touch me.

261
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,040
Take that you...

262
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,160
Rahul!

263
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,080
Stay back, father.

264
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,040
- Rahul.
- Ganya, take father away.

265
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,040
Let's go, let's go.

266
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,720
Wait a minute. They took my money.

267
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,080
Rahul.
Rahul, don't fight.

268
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,080
Rahul, listen.

269
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,800
Father.

270
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,000
"The world's a evil place."

271
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,480
"Filled with evil thoughts."

272
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,960
"Has run after,"

273
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,320
"dirty profession fast."

274
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,520
"Your last is written by his hand."

275
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,120
What are you looking at?

276
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,240
Sardars are not in Punjab alone.

277
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,800
Sardars are in every
corner of the world.

278
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,440
Even in Japan.

279
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,000
Where there are Sardars,
there's Gurdwara,

280
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,360
and a community kitchen.

281
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,560
No one ever starves.

282
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,400
You've only been
in the city for a week,

283
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,080
and already you got into trouble.

284
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,160
They were extorting
money from labours.

285
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,600
You should've paid too.

286
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
Sir, they were getting violent.

287
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,400
Then you should've taken a beating.

288
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,960
That place is filled with goons.

289
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,320
Why did you two have to be a hero?

290
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,800
We made a mistake, sir.
We'll never do it again.

291
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,600
Let us go.

292
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,440
You two are charged
with a half-murder case.

293
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,760
You two are almost there.

294
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,160
That Corporator Salvi
is a devious man.

295
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,160
Rahulya, Ganya,
what are you two doing inside?

296
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,800
Uday bro, you know these two?

297
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,760
Yes, these kids
are from my hometown.

298
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,440
I mean what have these two done?

299
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,040
Corporator Salvi has been extorting
money at the market yard for so long.

300
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,360
These two tried to be a hero.

301
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,240
Next week another labour
will refuse to pay him money.

302
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
They will stay in
lockup for two days.

303
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,080
Hoping they will get bail on Monday.

304
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,880
Otherwise, Salvi's men
are inside to take care of them.

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,360
Actually, they are good kids.

306
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,080
Sir, it's not their fault.

307
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
- They were just...
- Dutta.

308
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,240
Uday?

309
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,920
It's not their fault.

310
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,600
- Only to save me...
- Dutta, do you know them?

311
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,760
Yes, he's Rahul's father.

312
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
He's Maharastra Kesari (champion).

313
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,000
And that's his daughter.

314
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,080
Sorry sir,
but there's nothing we can do today.

315
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,720
If they get bail on Monday,

316
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,760
arrange for the bail money.

317
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,720
Money?

318
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,760
But I don't have...

319
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,080
Dutta uncle. Dutta uncle, I'm there.

320
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
Don't worry.

321
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
But brother Uday,
they haven't eaten food.

322
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,280
You're worried about
food at this time.

323
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,360
Anyway, come on.

324
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,360
I am there.

325
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,080
Come on, let's go.

326
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,360
Go on home. Look after your mother.

327
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
Did you like what you saw?

328
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,040
Thanks to you Maharastra Kesari was
standing helpless in front of me.

329
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,360
There's still time to change.

330
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Otherwise, your father will be
dead on the inside before you die.

331
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,360
Hello.

332
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,640
Greetings, Nanya bhai.

333
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,400
Greetings, bhai.

334
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,440
What can we do?

335
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
Hey, Desai.

336
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,320
You're being released today,
Nanya bhai.

337
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,760
Right. They are all my brothers.
Take good care of them.

338
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,840
Okay guys, see you.

339
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,840
We'll meet on the outside.

340
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
It won't be much fun without you.

341
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,960
Do you want me to
rot in jail for your fun?

342
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Come on, Nanya bhai.

343
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,080
Who are these two freshies?

344
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,320
These two roughed up Corporator
Salvi's boys in the market yard.

345
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,320
Them?

346
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Yes.

347
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,760
They are in for a beating today.

348
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,160
Wise guy.

349
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,160
What's the matter, brother?

350
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,680
Think you're a loose cannon.

351
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,760
- Yeah.
- Watch.

352
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,920
Why are you hitting us?

353
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,480
What did you do at the market yard?

354
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,480
Look, man, I acted in a fit of rage.

355
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,680
It was a mistake.

356
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,120
I said it was a mistake

357
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
Mistake, huh?

358
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
What are you staring at?

359
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,360
Look down.

360
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,080
That's it.

361
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,920
Hey...stop!

362
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,360
Hey...stop!

363
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,160
Back. Stay back. Back.

364
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,720
Come on. Back.

365
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
What happened?

366
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,440
Nanya bhai, he roughed
up boss' men at the market yard.

367
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,160
And now you roughed them up.

368
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,320
Scores settled.

369
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,320
But he broke Makya's head.

370
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,840
- Why you...
- Wait a minute. Back. Sit down.

371
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,200
These things happen
in a fit of rage.

372
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,640
- Now leave. Come on.
- But...

373
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,840
I said leave you fool.

374
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
Get lost.

375
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,320
Get lost.

376
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,360
Back. Back.

377
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,040
What's your name?

378
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,360
Rahul.

379
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,200
Ganya.

380
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,480
You two will get the bail.

381
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,400
Stay out of trouble until then.

382
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
Keep calm. Now get going.

383
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,360
Who is he?

384
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,120
You fool,
Nanya bhai is the king of Pune.

385
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,560
- Hey...
- Hello, Nanya bhai.

386
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,080
What happened?

387
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,240
Who roughed you up?

388
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,440
Sit. Sit.

389
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,840
Salvi's boys roughed them
up at night in jail.

390
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,800
Salvi's boys are such cowards.

391
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,760
I broke one's jaw and
gave the other a black eye.

392
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,040
Nice.

393
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,640
Don't you have sugar?

394
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,040
But this is jaggery.

395
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,160
Have it.

396
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,800
You guys are a classic case.

397
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,440
Not to worry.

398
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,080
Work with me.

399
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,640
Tell your family
no need to work anymore.

400
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
Right?

401
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,040
Nanya bhai...

402
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
I want to teach that
Corporator a lesson.

403
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,240
- Who?
- Salvi. Salvi.

404
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,840
He broke Ganya's arm,
now I'll break his arm.

405
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,560
That Salvi has a history behind him.

406
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,240
He always carries
a dozen boys with him.

407
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,120
How will you rough him up?

408
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,080
But boss, he goes to Chaufala
alone every Saturday.

409
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,320
To watch the dance.

410
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,360
His boys stay out.

411
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,280
"My my my my..."

412
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,280
"Listen carefully."

413
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,760
Let our secret become public."

414
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,040
"Let me put our story on Insta."

415
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,120
"This spark will
make us trend."

416
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,320
"This spark will give
us 100 million likes."

417
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,640
"Not a minute of peace,"

418
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,680
"this is a reel of our love."

419
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:18,160
"this is a reel of our love."

420
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,480
"No edit, no filter."

421
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,600
"Let it be a hit on the internet,
not on Twitter alone."

422
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:37,480
"I'll hashtag the entire world,
here comes the spark."

423
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,960
Corporator Salvi.

424
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,080
Yes.

425
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,800
"Why did you post this story?"

426
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,720
"The world will stalk you, dear."

427
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,360
"They will troll you for no reason."

428
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,880
"Your secret will be viral."

429
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:58,600
"here comes the spark."

430
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,240
"Come closer, sweetheart."

431
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,280
"Let me refill your
glass with my eyes."

432
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,360
"Let me swallow your darkness,"

433
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,400
"and give you the moon."

434
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,440
"Let me open all my secrets,"

435
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,240
"and tell you."

436
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,240
"Here comes the spark."

437
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,520
"Why did you post this story?"

438
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,640
"The world will stalk you, dear."

439
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,920
"They will troll you for no reason."

440
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
"Your secret will be viral."

441
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,240
"here comes the spark."

442
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,960
Let our secret become public."

443
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:03,160
"Let me put our story on Insta."

444
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,360
"This spark will
make us trend."

445
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:16,200
"This spark will give
us 100 million likes."

446
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,440
"Why did you hashtag your story?"

447
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,640
"Now your story
will become trending."

448
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,840
"You enchanted them with your eyes,"

449
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,680
"social-media is too powerful."

450
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,240
"here comes the spark."

451
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,840
Wow!

452
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,480
Look Ganya, squandering labour's
money on his hobbies.

453
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,800
Bloody rascal.

454
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
Why you?

455
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,720
Listen, if I ever see you
or your boys in the market yard,

456
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,520
then I will skin you alive
and make a shoe out of it.

457
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,720
You'll die like a dog.

458
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,480
What are you doing?

459
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,200
- Why you...
- Ganya, let's go.

460
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,800
Don't pick up this money.

461
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,440
Come on.

462
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,120
Rahul.

463
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,200
Sir, I didn't want to kill him.

464
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,320
But he came after me with a chopper.

465
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,920
And I only pushed him.

466
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,440
If I hadn't reacted
he would've killed me, sir.

467
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,400
Did you go there to
invite him to your wedding?

468
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,560
If we make a self-defence case...

469
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,200
Seems difficult.

470
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,440
There's a strong case against them.

471
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,880
They will face imprisonment.

472
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,680
MLA and Nanya together.

473
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,080
What are they doing here?

474
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,120
Hello, Rajveer.

475
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,920
- Hey, pull the chair.
- Yes sir.

476
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,920
What brings you here?

477
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,760
If you treat innocent
youngsters like this,

478
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,640
then as a public servant
I've to show up at your door.

479
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,320
They confessed that they
killed the Corporator.

480
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,880
If you torture them,
anyone will confess.

481
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,360
Turn on the TV.

482
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,400
Watch the latest breaking news.

483
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
The other day the
Corporator was drunk.

484
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,400
I told him to stay over.
But he didn't listen to me.

485
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,080
During the tussle, he rammed
into the glass and died.

486
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,960
I tried stopping
him from getting drunk,

487
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,000
but he assaulted me.

488
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,120
And then he fell down and died.

489
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,440
So it's clear

490
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,760
- that Corporator Salvi wasn't murdered.
- Switch it off.

491
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,560
It was an accident.

492
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,720
Bail papers.
Do you want to see it?

493
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,200
No.

494
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,560
Brother Uday, let them go.

495
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,880
- Touch the MLA's feet.
- Sir.

496
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,160
- It's okay.
- Sir.

497
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,200
You two did the right thing.

498
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,280
That Salvi was getting
to be a pain in the neck.

499
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,720
You put him down. Good.

500
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,440
But sir, how could his men lie?

501
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,240
We put a gun to his wife's head,

502
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,960
and he started
singing in our favour.

503
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,080
Simple.

504
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,600
Nanya, even I will put a gun
to your head like this?

505
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,960
And then I want to see how you sing.

506
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,520
Rajveer, calm down.

507
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,680
Do you want to get suspended again?

508
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,040
Doesn't matter.

509
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,840
Better change.
Come on.

510
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,040
- Soman, complete the procedure.
- Yes.

511
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,720
Come on, guys. Let's go, let's go.

512
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,200
Order some tea.

513
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,800
Nanavare, order some tea.
These things take time.

514
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,280
Only tea?

515
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,000
- Yes, tea.
- Bread-butter, toast?

516
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,480
No, only tea.

517
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
Is this Police Station
your father's house?

518
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,840
Water is fine?
Yes.

519
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,520
Offering water is a good deed.

520
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,920
I will see you.

521
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,000
My name is Advocate Soman.

522
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,480
I'm leaving now.
But I'll deal with you later.

523
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,120
Sir, did you get suspended?

524
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,360
Yes. This happened two years ago.

525
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
There was a drug
gang in the college,

526
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,840
who first got a girl
addicted to drugs.

527
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,560
And then raped her.

528
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,280
They threw acid on her face
and left her outside the college.

529
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,200
I couldn't bear it.

530
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,160
I took the law in my hand.

531
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,080
And didn't spare even
a single member of this gang.

532
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,320
The Human Rights people made
a fuss on this MLA's instructions.

533
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,480
And I was suspended for two years.

534
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,680
But crime will never end.

535
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,240
We never can.

536
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,480
Another goon took Gulshan's place,

537
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,480
and he got MLA's support.

538
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,040
He became Nanya bhai.

539
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,600
Now Rahul will take
Nanya bhai's place.

540
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,400
We cannot do anything
even if we want to.

541
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,680
Our hands are tied.

542
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,280
We can only supply raw materials.

543
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,080
To do these politicians' dirty jobs.

544
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,880
Careful, Dutta.

545
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,920
- Here.
- Father.

546
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,360
No more menial labour.

547
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,200
You took this burden off my back,

548
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,480
but what about the
burden on my chest?

549
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,120
What burden, father?

550
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,120
You killed a man.

551
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,320
Me? I was proven innocent, father.

552
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,040
Call it destiny, Rahul.

553
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,560
This is your chance to reform.

554
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,800
Look, we'll have half a square meal,

555
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,120
but make an honest living.

556
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,440
Father,
I'll have a full square meal.

557
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,240
Along with a sweet dish.

558
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,520
Criminals only end
up in the graveyard,

559
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,880
or be destroyed like this Satya.

560
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,440
Leave it, father.

561
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,800
Let's go to my new house along
with my mother and Seema.

562
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,600
You're not old enough to
shoulder our burden.

563
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,080
We have a long day ahead.

564
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Have to make an honest living.

565
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,920
Okay, father. As you wish.

566
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,800
I don't want to eat.

567
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,280
Eat it!

568
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,560
Hey...why are you hitting the child?

569
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,840
She isn't eating.

570
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,840
Why aren't you eating?

571
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,640
Every day the same
old flour vegetable.

572
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,000
I am not going to et it.

573
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,240
We sell vegetables
from our fields here.

574
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,200
And feeds us
this flour vegetable.

575
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Did you come here
to sell your vegetables?

576
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,680
Yes, sir.

577
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,440
That's my truck.

578
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,320
- How much did you sell it for?
- 8000

579
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,280
- Fertilizer, seeds, medicines?
- 1500

580
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,440
- And the truck's rental?
- 3500

581
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,880
- Toll, food?
- 1500

582
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,280
- How much?
- 6500

583
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,720
- How much is he left with?
- 1500

584
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
All this trouble for 1500?

585
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,000
What to do, sir?

586
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,760
Those agents don't
pay the right price.

587
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,760
Come with me.

588
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,080
Hello, sir.

589
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,160
Pay him.

590
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,400
I already did.

591
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,760
You got paid.
What else do you want?

592
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,520
8000 isn't enough, sir.

593
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,840
It's too less.

594
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,520
You guys are just...

595
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,960
Here, another 500.

596
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,440
This won't help, sir.

597
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,280
I want at least 12,000 for my truck.

598
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,920
Get lost with your truck.
Get out.

599
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,800
- Listen to me, sir.
- Take the money back.

600
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,240
- No, sir.
- If I ever see you in the market again,

601
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,520
I will break your legs.

602
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,480
No, sir. Listen to me.

603
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,400
Let's see who buys
your truck for 12,000.

604
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,880
I will buy it.

605
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,040
- Never seen him before.
- I'll buy his vegetables for 12,000.

606
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,520
Hey...I've been buying vegetables
in this market for 12 years.

607
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,960
I've seen people
like you come and go.

608
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,280
Next time you open your mouth,

609
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,680
I'll break your jaw and
shove it down your throat.

610
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,680
Hey...what are you doing?

611
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,560
Listen to me.

612
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,800
How much are you going to beat me?

613
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,160
I only roughed you up today.

614
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,360
If I see you in the market again,

615
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,640
I will break your
legs and shove it up the...

616
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,360
Everyone has two holes, up and...

617
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,000
Understood?

618
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,720
Get lost.

619
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,520
And listen,
now I will buy your vegetables.

620
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,920
And the rate is...

621
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,640
- Tell them.
- 12,000 rupees per truck!

622
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,360
- Long live...
- Rahul!

623
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,000
- Long live...
- Rahul!

624
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,760
- Long live...
- Rahul!

625
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,240
- Long live...
- Rahul!

626
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,840
- Long live...
- Rahul!

627
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,280
- Long live...
- Rahul!

628
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,000
- Long live...
- Rahul!

629
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,840
- Long live...
- Rahul!

630
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,240
- Long live...
- Rahul!

631
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,920
Tell Manda one special tea.

632
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,920
A truckload of vegetables
costs 32,000 at retail price.

633
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,760
Meaning 24,000 profit.

634
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,400
That's why I offered them 12.

635
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,680
Let's become partners.

636
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,640
Your brains and my money.

637
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,280
Boss, Daya and Pitya.

638
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,280
What are they doing here?

639
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,000
Who are Daya and Pitya?

640
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,720
Small-time crooks of Bund Garden.

641
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,160
They take on small-time jobs.

642
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,160
They are from Mulshi as well.

643
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,240
- Hello, Nanya bhai.
- Daya, Pitya, sit down.

644
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,440
Hey... Pitambar dada, Digambar dada.

645
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,880
What are you doing here?

646
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,720
You know them.

647
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,120
They were our boys.

648
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,640
They used to get cigarettes
and booze for us.

649
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,120
We used to hit them on
the head to get a job done.

650
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,720
Don't try that now
or they will screw you.

651
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,880
You must be joking, Nanya bhai.

652
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,240
I am not joking.

653
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,400
They murdered Corporator Salvi.

654
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,840
Really?

655
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,960
Nanya bhai, he always had guts.

656
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,200
He's that Dutta wrestler's son.

657
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,440
How is Dutta uncle?

658
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,840
Dutta wrestler is now
a labour at the market yard.

659
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,840
Nanya bhai, when I was in school...

660
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,640
Listen, fool, don't start
narrating his family story,

661
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,840
...tell me why you're here.

662
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,000
Oh yes.

663
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,160
There's a property of 50 acres.

664
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,720
Needs to be vacated.

665
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,040
It's a big job.

666
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,760
Not our cup of tea.

667
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,920
What do I get?

668
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,160
The client's offering 60 million.

669
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,800
We'll split it fifty-fifty.

670
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,920
- Done.
- What done?

671
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,720
It's the same property
we tried to vacate earlier.

672
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,440
It has 26 owners.

673
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,840
That is a native land...

674
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,160
We'll get screwed for good.

675
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,840
The Kamble family land...

676
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,360
- That property?
- Leave guys, not possible.

677
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,280
What if I try?

678
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,280
Even the best of the
best tried their hand.

679
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,560
What can you do?

680
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,960
Lawyer...
let me try there is nothing to lose.

681
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,760
Why is he telling me to get up?

682
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,880
I want to sit.
Sit down. Sit down.

683
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,120
He's telling me to get up.

684
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,240
Go ahead and try.

685
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,240
I'll try Nanya bhai, but fifty-fifty
doesn't sound right.

686
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,640
Now you want a share too?

687
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,200
Come on Nanya bhai,
will I ask you for a share?

688
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,280
I mean you keep
90% and they keep 10.

689
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,880
We brought this job.

690
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,800
Then do it yourself
and take the entire share.

691
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,600
He's got a point.

692
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,600
- Nanya...
- He's got a point.

693
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,560
- Okay, 30%
- 12.

694
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,960
- 20%
- 15.

695
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,720
18...

696
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,440
Hey fool, what is this a chop shop?

697
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,440
- Get lost?
- Okay fine, Nanya bhai.

698
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,040
15 is okay.

699
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,920
Hey lawyer,
keep every owner's document ready.

700
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,320
Cheers.
Cheers.

701
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,600
Put your thumb impression here.

702
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,400
I'm asking you politely,
Put your thumb impression here.

703
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,680
We'll pay you more
money if you like,

704
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,160
but quietly put your
thumb impression here.

705
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,200
I won't put my thumb impression here
until the Master doesn't say so.

706
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,640
Ganya, who is their master?

707
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,360
The same guy who
threw you out of school.

708
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,400
I see...

709
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,840
Let your master come.

710
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,160
We'll settle some old scores.

711
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,440
Look, speak of the
devil and he's here.

712
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,560
Soman, you'll never learn, will you?

713
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,520
I get paid so my
job is to keep trying.

714
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,280
For the last time,

715
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,200
I'd rather die but
never sell my land.

716
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,880
- As you wish.
- If you're dead,

717
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,640
how would you know
this is your land or not?

718
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,200
Rahul.

719
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,840
What are you doing here?

720
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,480
I've taken up the
job to vacate your land.

721
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,480
Now come and sign the papers.

722
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,480
Leave my hand.

723
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,400
I saw your true colors at a
very young age, shameless.

724
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,040
That's why I threw
you out of school.

725
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,520
You did the right thing.

726
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,120
Because if I had continued studying,

727
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,760
I would've become a clerk.

728
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,920
Or maybe with my good luck,
an officer.

729
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,800
But you see, master,

730
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,080
even the biggest officer wet
their pants when they see me.

731
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,600
Let's sign the papers.

732
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,840
Master...

733
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,680
I am not scared of anyone.

734
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,400
Being a farmer's
son you stooped so low!

735
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,200
I won't sign!

736
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,600
Master, stop irritating me.

737
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,720
Or what?
What will you do?

738
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,360
Do you want to know your place?

739
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,000
Why the...

740
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,880
God!

741
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,240
Lawyer, what are you waiting for?

742
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,720
Take his thumb impression.

743
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,480
Even a dead man's
thumb is still a thumb.

744
00:43:59,560 --> 00:43:59,960
Right away.

745
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,240
Ganya, take everyone's
thumb impression.

746
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,880
26 owners 26 stamp papers.

747
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,360
So he killed Maruti Kamble.

748
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,160
Yes, sir. He did.

749
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,240
He's Maruti Kamble's uncle.

750
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,440
And you're bothering
Rahul's parents for no reason.

751
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,960
He's the hero.

752
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,440
Tell sir.

753
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,760
I needed money.

754
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,720
And Maruti Kamble was being unfair.

755
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,640
So I shot him in a fit of rage.

756
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,840
Yes...I was telling him.

757
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,960
Okay, fine. That's enough.

758
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,320
Shooting him is one thing,

759
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,800
first, hold this gun.

760
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,120
What's the point?

761
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,480
He's admitting his
crime so arrest him.

762
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,440
You're such a rascal.

763
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,000
Some day I will strip you naked.

764
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,040
If we ever meet in court,

765
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,520
I will strip you naked
in the witness box.

766
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,400
Without taking a single cloth off.

767
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,440
I accept your challenge.

768
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,240
Tell me something,
how did you do it?

769
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,840
The old man was under a lot of debt.

770
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,280
We paid him.

771
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,880
Now he and his family will never
have to worry about money.

772
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,240
They are happy.
Yes...

773
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,960
He gave and I took.

774
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,640
And killed him.

775
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,200
- Isn't that right?
- It's okay, go on now.

776
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,960
- All done here.
- Fine.

777
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,000
Good boy.

778
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,800
Here's Rahul's anticipatory bail.

779
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,080
Now order some tea.

780
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,000
No, no, no...

781
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,920
There's already a shortage
of water in Vidarbha.

782
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,040
It's not right that you keep
wasting water on me.

783
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,000
Is it mineral water?

784
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,800
He was your teacher.
He taught you in school.

785
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,040
And you killed him.

786
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,600
I didn't kill him, mother.

787
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,960
His own uncle killed him.

788
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,320
It's all over the newspaper and TV.

789
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
See it for yourself.

790
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,640
Just like you didn't
kill the Corporator.

791
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,600
Go away, come on.

792
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,200
I said go.

793
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,560
You guys are being crazy.

794
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,880
Seema, please talk to them.

795
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,040
What will she say?

796
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,240
Ganya, take him away.

797
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,840
Then die here.

798
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,840
Seema, come with me.

799
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,000
Come on.

800
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,760
- Seema.
- Come on.

801
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,760
Get lost.
Don't ever come back here.

802
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,880
MLA sir, good morning.

803
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,840
Nanya, what brings you
here at this early hour?

804
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,600
I have to show up
when you don't do my job.

805
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,440
What job?

806
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,560
Salvi is dead.

807
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,320
And I suggested Dagdu Khapre's
name for the by-elections.

808
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,480
What happened?

809
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,360
Khapre has two murder
charges against him.

810
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,840
Listen Hambir, you never
had a clean record yourself.

811
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,120
But you're still the MLA.

812
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,240
The party president
isn't too happy with Khapre.

813
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,400
The other party is
ready to give him a ticket.

814
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,960
Then that same party will put...

815
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,560
...me against you in the
assembly elections.

816
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,640
Then you're done.

817
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,840
Don't get angry.

818
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,600
Fine, Khapre's seat is fixed.

819
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,240
I give you my word.

820
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,640
I knew you'll do the job.

821
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,120
See you.

822
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,920
- Did you unload the vehicle?
- I did.

823
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,680
Dutta, everyone looks happy.

824
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,360
Your son's made farmers life better.

825
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,920
He's also shed a
lot of blood for it.

826
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,200
Rahul, did you really
kill Maruti Kamble?

827
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,720
Look, Manda,
don't listen to my father.

828
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,440
Then why do people keep saying it?

829
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,440
I don't know.

830
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,960
It's also in the newspapers
that his uncle killed him.

831
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,600
My father is drunk all
the time, but he loves me.

832
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,560
Even I love you a lot.

833
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,360
Rahul, he'll take every
decision in my life.

834
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,600
And he will never let his
daughter marry a criminal.

835
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,760
What was he?

836
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,400
That's why he won't.

837
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,560
- Nanya bhai...
- Ganya...

838
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,440
Let it be.

839
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,760
- Where is Rahul?
- He's right here.

840
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,040
Rahul. Rahul. Nanya bhai's here.

841
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,520
You go.

842
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,800
Nanya bhai,
you showed up so suddenly.

843
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,800
- Nanya bhai...
- My angry young man!

844
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,440
Don't touch my feet.
Don't touch my feet.

845
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,840
Give me a hug.

846
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,560
Awesome.

847
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,880
You're my little brother.

848
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,600
What were you doing in the corner,

849
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,600
with that girl?

850
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,760
She's hot.

851
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,280
Really hot.

852
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,760
We're serious, Nanya bhai.

853
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,000
Are you done with her?

854
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,000
What are you saying, Nanya bhai?

855
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,080
It's not like that.

856
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,480
Let me know after you're done.

857
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,040
I like her.

858
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,480
We're brothers after all.

859
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
Together we can enjoy.

860
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,960
As I said Nanya bhai,
I love her.

861
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,360
We're serious.

862
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,520
I was only joking.

863
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,520
I got something for you.

864
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,640
Bring it.

865
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,400
Look. How is it?

866
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,080
It's awesome.

867
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,000
It's for you.

868
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,520
But there was no need for this,
Nanya bhai.

869
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,520
Need.

870
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,080
The deal on Maruti
Kamble's land is done.

871
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,560
26 agreements are lying in the car.

872
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,680
- Throw the key.
- Yes, boss. Here you go, boss.

873
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,440
Take this key.

874
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,440
Get in that car, and come
to my birthday tonight.

875
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,480
- On-time.
- Yes, brother.

876
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,360
Because until he doesn't arrive,

877
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,320
I won't cut the cake.

878
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,320
- Right, guys.
- Absolutely right.

879
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,760
Be there on time.

880
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,160
Come on.

881
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,200
Now he's your brother.

882
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,600
When your own family leaves you,

883
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,040
strangers become your kin.

884
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,600
- Go ahead.
- Rahulya, sit.

885
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,360
Sit here.

886
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,040
Sit here,
I'll tell you that rascal's story.

887
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,560
Sit. Sit.

888
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,560
When Shinde bought
your father's land,

889
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,800
at a dirt-cheap price.

890
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,160
Do you know how?

891
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,560
Because of this Nanya bhai.

892
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,840
This Nanya put a gun
to your sister's head,

893
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,440
and said put your thumb
impression on the paper.

894
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,000
Otherwise, first, he will
rape your sister and then kill her.

895
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,400
Your father had no choice.

896
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,000
He put his thumb impression.

897
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,920
And now this Nanya is your brother.

898
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,640
Now deal with the consequences
of your own choice.

899
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,000
Bloody useless...

900
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,920
That's all I have.

901
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
What are you doing?

902
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,560
Not my cigarette too.

903
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,320
"Make him understand"

904
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,240
Tell him.

905
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,680
What are you all looking at?
Is this a drama?

906
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,040
Get lost.

907
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,760
Hello.

908
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,680
Wait a minute.

909
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,080
Rahul. MLA Hambir.

910
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,200
Hello.

911
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,440
"There's only one
tiger in this area."

912
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,200
"Everyone's overwhelmed
when he arrives."

913
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,720
"Heaps of gold piled up,"

914
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,720
"let's dance my crazy."

915
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,840
"Heaps of gold piled up,"

916
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,760
"let's dance my crazy."

917
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,640
"We'll break the speakers,"

918
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,840
"blast the firecrackers."

919
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,840
"Pour whiskey all night."

920
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,480
"We'll have a ball,
we'll have a blast."

921
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,560
"It's our brother's birthday."

922
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,760
"It's our brother's birthday."

923
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,640
"It's our brother's birthday."

924
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,680
"It's our brother's birthday."

925
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,840
"It's our brother's birthday."

926
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,880
"Market free, cigarette free,"

927
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,000
"ordered biryani with extra ghee."

928
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,480
"We're going to scream and shout."

929
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,880
"Market free, cigarette free,"

930
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,000
"ordered biryani with extra ghee."

931
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,120
"Chocolate cake's too big."

932
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,960
"The arrangement's just too great."

933
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,680
"Kolhapur, Sholapur, Satara."

934
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,800
"Wife will dance,
sister-in-law will dance."

935
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,440
"So will the old man."

936
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,640
"It's our brother's birthday."

937
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,920
"It's our brother's birthday."

938
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,720
"It's our brother's birthday."

939
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,640
"It's our brother's birthday."

940
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,600
"It's our brother's birthday."

941
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,840
"No one's gonna mess with us,"

942
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,920
"we've already made all setting."

943
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,960
"No on, Dagdu."

944
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,840
"No one's gonna mess with us,"

945
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,880
"we've already made all setting."

946
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,360
"We'll spread the carpet, "

947
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,680
"and make girls do the catwalk."

948
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,600
"We'll booze all night,"
"and puke in the morning."

949
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,760
"It's 12 o'clock."

950
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,680
"It's our brother's birthday."

951
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,040
"It's our brother's birthday."

952
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,400
"It's our brother's birthday."

953
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,880
"It's our brother's birthday."

954
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,320
"It's our brother's birthday."

955
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,360
"Happy happy birthday."

956
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,800
"Happy happy birthday."

957
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,520
"Happy happy birthday."

958
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,120
"Happy happy birthday."

959
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,560
"It's our brother's birthday."

960
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,960
"It's our brother's birthday."

961
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,440
"It's our brother's birthday."

962
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,840
"It's our brother's birthday."

963
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,240
"It's our brother's birthday."

964
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,760
"It's our brother's birthday."

965
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,240
Hey lawyer, will you defend my case?

966
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,440
Of course.

967
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,800
Then hold this.

968
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,000
Come on.

969
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,520
Do you like getting
embarrassed every time?

970
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,800
I want to shoot you right now.

971
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,360
Mind your tongue, sir.

972
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,800
Stop hitting the weak.

973
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,480
Show me what you got.

974
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,000
Come on.

975
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,520
I respect this uniform, sir,

976
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,080
that's why I am quiet.

977
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,960
Whether you respect
this uniform or not,

978
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,320
but we sure do.

979
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:01,120
- Uday, look after this properly.
- Yes.

980
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,560
While I rough him up politely.

981
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,840
My father was Maharashtra Kesari.

982
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,920
Your father was Maharashtra Kesari.

983
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,680
I am Hind Kesari.

984
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,880
Do you know
I am Pune's new don?

985
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,520
You are Pune's new don,

986
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,840
but I was always the hero of India.

987
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,000
"The world's an evil place."

988
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,280
"Filled with evil thoughts."

989
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,920
"Has run after,"

990
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,880
"dirty profession fast."

991
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,720
"Your last is written by his hand."

992
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,520
There were more than
200 guests at that party.

993
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,240
No one saw anything.

994
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,120
But Rahul was charged
with Nanya's murder.

995
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,120
Rahul is a decent
and talented worker.

996
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,920
But the Police have
a personal enmity with him.

997
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,880
The Corporator died in an accident,

998
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,160
but Rahul was arrested.

999
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,560
Maruti Kamble was
murdered by his uncle.

1000
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,680
But Rahul was accused of it again.

1001
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,840
And now this.

1002
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,720
But Police can't continue
this dictatorship for long.

1003
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,280
Hey lawyer,
how long will this case last?

1004
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,440
What case?

1005
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,440
There's no witness.

1006
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,840
The judge will throw
it out on the first day.

1007
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,880
By the way,
Daya and Pitya want to meet.

1008
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,360
Later.

1009
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:39,880
- Where is Uday?
- Sir.

1010
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,880
That way.

1011
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,360
Hello, sir.

1012
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,720
Sir.

1013
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,280
Sit, Uday.

1014
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,840
- Sir, do you know?
- Rahul got bail.

1015
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,520
So you know.

1016
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,200
Did you really believe
Rahul will rot in jail forever?

1017
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,400
Until people like corrupt
MLA Hambir are out there,

1018
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,320
these guys will get bail.

1019
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,040
We got a gun but every
bullet is accounted for.

1020
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,160
But these guys...

1021
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,040
Nothing.

1022
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,640
Meaning we'll do nothing.

1023
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,880
We will.

1024
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,000
We will use our minds.

1025
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,720
Have you read the Mahabharata?

1026
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,800
No, but I've seen it on TV.

1027
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,360
Who was the hero of Mahabharata?

1028
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,480
Arjun.

1029
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,760
His aim was perfect.

1030
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,880
But the brain was Lord Krishna.

1031
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,000
He pitted brothers against
each other to end unrighteousness.

1032
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,040
So to end crime,

1033
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,920
why can't we pit these
criminals against each other.

1034
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:37,840
Great.

1035
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,480
What an idea?

1036
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,200
How do you like my nature?

1037
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,040
Nice. You're very calm.

1038
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,160
Because I don't raise my voice,
I don't abuse,

1039
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,080
I am not violent.
There is a lot of anger in me.

1040
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,360
The day this Sardar loses it,

1041
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,320
everyone will be scared stiff.

1042
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,400
Rahul...

1043
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,520
Daya, Pitya.

1044
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,520
Not them again.

1045
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,520
Make another one for me.

1046
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,440
How are you, Rahul?

1047
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,560
Great. What's wrong with me?

1048
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,560
What brings you here?

1049
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,640
Needed something.

1050
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,480
The contract on Kamble.

1051
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,160
We're here to collect our 15%

1052
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,600
Look...Nanya's case turned
out to be too expensive.

1053
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:22,960
Things are not good.

1054
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,000
Even we're not in such
a good position, Rahul.

1055
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,000
You know what, keep 600,000.

1056
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,680
Let's settle the rest later.

1057
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,200
What good is 600,000?

1058
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,760
Our share is 9 million.

1059
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I told you to keep this 600,000.

1060
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,920
Someone's coming to meet me.
Get going you two.

1061
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,000
Leave. Are you waiting for dinner?

1062
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,160
Rahul...

1063
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Sister-in-law.

1064
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,760
Leave, guys.

1065
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:06,920
Come on.

1066
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,760
Rahul, I got to leave early today.

1067
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:22,720
"I've nothing to lose
or gain except for you."

1068
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:29,000
"Without you, I cannot live."

1069
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:34,120
"Without you, I've nowhere to go."

1070
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,840
"I am falling for you."

1071
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:45,200
"Since you showered
your love on me."

1072
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:50,560
"Yes, it's happening."

1073
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:56,040
"It's happening."

1074
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,560
"I am falling in love."

1075
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,560
"Yes, I am falling in love."

1076
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:12,440
"I am falling for you,"

1077
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,880
"you're falling for me."

1078
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,120
"I am falling in love."

1079
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:27,640
"Yes, I am falling in love."

1080
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,800
"The ambience seems scarlet,"

1081
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,560
"stars scattered everywhere."

1082
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:21,760
"Take me in your arms,"

1083
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,480
"so we lose ourselves."

1084
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:30,840
"I am wherever you are."

1085
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,680
"I am the tune you're the music."

1086
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,040
"I am falling for you."

1087
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,440
"Since you showered
your love on me."

1088
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:54,080
"Yes, it's happening."

1089
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:59,560
"It's happening."

1090
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:04,680
"I am falling in love."

1091
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:10,280
"Yes, I am falling in love."

1092
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,680
"I am falling for you,"

1093
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,200
"you're falling for me."

1094
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:26,560
"I am falling in love."

1095
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:31,200
"Yes, I am falling in love."

1096
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,680
I need a file urgently,

1097
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,280
but can't remember which one.

1098
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,840
Padwal, remember...

1099
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,960
I've been looking for it
since morning, but can't remember.

1100
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,480
- Sir, what about this one?
- No, no, can't be in this one.

1101
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,560
Then...

1102
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,360
Sir, he's annoyed now.

1103
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,600
Brother Uday,
I've been waiting for half an hour.

1104
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,400
Give me the register
so I can sign it.

1105
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,800
Are you some Minister
to get VIP treatment?

1106
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,520
Put your feet down.

1107
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,200
Put your feet down
or else I will break it.

1108
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,800
Bloody cheap goon.

1109
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:34,040
Several Police officers survive
because of this cheap goon.

1110
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,480
You survive on our leftovers.

1111
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,400
And is this your honest living
which you're squandering away?

1112
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,160
You earn by snatching
lands from poor farmers.

1113
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,320
Coward.

1114
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,960
When this coward becomes
the MLA tomorrow,

1115
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,240
then a minister.

1116
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,520
Will you salute him then?

1117
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,240
Will you survive till then?

1118
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,400
We've a list of monsters like you,

1119
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,600
who ended up in the
grave before swearing-in.

1120
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,280
Sir, I am different.

1121
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,280
I will survive.

1122
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,320
And someday also become
the CM of Maharashtra.

1123
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,800
Nothing lasts forever in this world,

1124
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,920
except for plastic.

1125
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,360
Then think of me as plastic.

1126
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,440
And I promise you,

1127
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,200
someday you'll be saluting me,

1128
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,000
and even fall at my feet.

1129
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,680
I am a Sardar.

1130
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,000
I only bow before the Lord.

1131
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,240
When I get a chance
I will shoot you.

1132
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:09,560
Uday, take this illiterate's
thumb impression.

1133
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:15,080
If I lose my mind, I will
put his brains on this register.

1134
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,360
Maharashtra's CM.

1135
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,000
Daya, it's been too long.

1136
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,360
Patwardhan will be here soon.

1137
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,080
Your watch is really cool,
brother Pitya.

1138
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,160
- Like it?
- Yes.

1139
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,600
Here.

1140
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,240
- No, no, I was just...
- Keep it.

1141
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,720
Hey...who are you guys?

1142
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,040
- What is this charade?
- Here he comes?

1143
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,280
- How did you two get inside?
- Through the gate.

1144
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,880
Coming inside our
own farm is no crime.

1145
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,080
Your farm?

1146
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,360
Can't you read?

1147
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,000
Read that.

1148
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,560
This property belongs
to Vijay Patwardhan.

1149
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,320
Trespassers will be prosecuted.

1150
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,520
Sorry, sorry.

1151
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,640
Now get out.

1152
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:04,960
Get out.

1153
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,280
Where do you think you're going?

1154
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,760
What are you doing?

1155
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,240
Quiet.

1156
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,440
Give me that.

1157
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,920
What are you doing?

1158
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:14,960
Now read this.

1159
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,720
My father's land.

1160
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,200
Do whatever you want.

1161
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,320
Pitya and Daya.

1162
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,840
You don't know who got me this land.

1163
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,760
Who?

1164
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,040
Rahul.

1165
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,680
Brother, brother, listen.

1166
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,080
Please let me go inside.

1167
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,640
- Bhaskar, throw him out.
- Please listen.

1168
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,680
Get out.

1169
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,560
I just want to talk.

1170
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,080
- Just let me talk to him once.
- What's going on there?

1171
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,200
He's been waiting
here since morning.

1172
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,600
He's insisting on meeting you.

1173
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,520
Let me go inside.

1174
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,000
Let him in.

1175
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:49,800
Come on.

1176
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,400
What's your name?

1177
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,480
Siddharth.

1178
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,120
Do you want money?

1179
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,600
Job. With you.

1180
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,920
What does your father do?

1181
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,920
He died two years ago.

1182
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,960
Three months later my
mother committed suicide.

1183
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,720
Since I had no job I stole.

1184
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,840
I was in the remand
home for two years.

1185
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,320
Someone said Rahulya
dada is a good man.

1186
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,320
So I came to you.

1187
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,600
Keep this money. Keep it.

1188
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,320
And don't hesitate
to ask if you want more.

1189
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,120
Understood.

1190
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,480
Someone take him home.

1191
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,600
- Go on, son.
- Brother.

1192
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,960
- Brother, I've no one.
- Listen.

1193
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,520
Let me stay with you.

1194
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,440
Boss...

1195
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,680
Don't be scared. Jump.

1196
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,960
I am right here.

1197
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,800
No, father. I am scared.

1198
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,920
I am right here.

1199
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,800
Where are you going?

1200
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,520
Use your hands and feet.

1201
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,640
Bravo, my son.

1202
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,960
Bravo.

1203
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,240
I told you I am always with you.

1204
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:57,960
Boss is calling.

1205
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,680
Yes, boss.

1206
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,040
Bandya,
where did you leave that boy?

1207
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,080
Nowhere, boss.
He's still sitting outside the gate.

1208
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,520
Bring him inside.

1209
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,600
Okay, boss.

1210
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,000
Boss.

1211
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:13,960
Come on.

1212
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,680
You go.

1213
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,440
Sit.

1214
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,840
Not there, sit here.

1215
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,320
Here?

1216
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,480
Yes.

1217
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,360
You want to stay with me.

1218
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,280
I won't leave you
until you're alive.

1219
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,000
I'll do everything you say.

1220
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,840
You'll attend school from tomorrow.

1221
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,280
I'll get you the best education.

1222
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,360
I'll never let you miss your father.

1223
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,800
I know how it feels
not having a father.

1224
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,040
Not the feet.
Not the feet. Not the feet.

1225
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,120
Sit here.

1226
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,000
You're my best friend now.

1227
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,760
Go on.

1228
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,160
Rahul.

1229
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,200
What?

1230
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,280
Remember Patwardhan whom
we got a place in Mulshi.

1231
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,400
What about him?

1232
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,440
Daya and Pitya seized his place,

1233
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,280
and shot him in the leg.

1234
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,640
We must soon take care of
these fools Daya and Pitya.

1235
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,960
And what time do we have
to go to the IT Park tomorrow?

1236
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,040
10 o'clock.

1237
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,000
But what's in the IT Park.

1238
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,600
Golden egg laying gooses.

1239
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,520
What?

1240
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,680
You bought the farmer's
land at dirt cheap price,

1241
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,120
and built this IT Park.

1242
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,200
Now those poor farmers are either
working as labour in the market yard,

1243
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,880
become drunkards,
or committing suicide.

1244
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,320
And you scoundrels
are making millions.

1245
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,400
You'll have to pay a share.

1246
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,960
We make an honest living here.

1247
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,920
Do you think we'll easily
pay up if you threaten us like this?

1248
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,280
Of course, you will.

1249
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,520
And if I say no,

1250
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,360
then you'll beg me
to take your honest money.

1251
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,360
Otherwise, everyone will
get a bullet in the head.

1252
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,920
Taking my opinion and
going against it. Sit. Sit.

1253
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,000
Sir, please. Please, sir.

1254
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,200
Sit.

1255
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,120
Sit, sit.

1256
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,240
Your villagers have
started a new shop.

1257
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,480
Meaning.

1258
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,880
IT Park, extortion...

1259
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,800
20 million every month.

1260
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:32,840
That much.

1261
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,160
That was Agarwal on the line.

1262
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,680
He's scared.

1263
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,560
I said make an NC.

1264
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,120
No.

1265
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,360
So.

1266
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,920
Brother Uday,
have you seen a cockfight?

1267
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,200
Several times in my village.

1268
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,880
We'll make your
two cocks fight here.

1269
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,520
It's going to be a lot of fun.

1270
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,440
- Padwal.
- Sir.

1271
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,120
Call Pitya.

1272
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,160
Tell him that his share
of the IT Park money,

1273
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,600
is going to Rahul now.

1274
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,880
Sir.

1275
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,960
Pitya.

1276
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,240
Father, how are you?

1277
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,520
How is mother?

1278
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,920
Who is he?

1279
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,160
Are you angry?

1280
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,160
I don't know.

1281
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,840
What kind of an answer is that?

1282
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,680
I read the newspaper every day.

1283
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,160
They write nonsense.
Don't read them.

1284
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,640
Ganya, come here.

1285
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,240
What is it, Satya bhai?

1286
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,040
Give me a hand.

1287
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,000
That Rahul is so rich,

1288
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,440
why does he still
come here to drink tea?

1289
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,960
He's your future son-in-law.

1290
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,240
Scoundrel, that's my daughter.

1291
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,800
I would rather throw
her in front of a train,

1292
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:36,040
then let her marry him.

1293
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,280
Rahul, Satya bhai is refusing
to let you marry Manda.

1294
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,200
I'm not scared of him.

1295
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,240
- Even I was a gangster at a time.
- Why that...

1296
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,680
But I wasn't a coward like him.

1297
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,080
Listen you,
drunkard, I am not asking you.

1298
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,160
If you don't agree then
I will take her forcefully.

1299
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,360
I see...

1300
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,680
Rahulya, when I get a headache,

1301
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:03,480
there's a shop nearby
where I buy aspirins.

1302
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,120
Two for rupee 1.

1303
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:12,840
But I check it twice
for its expiry date.

1304
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,400
She's my daughter.

1305
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,720
Who is she?
My daughter.

1306
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:20,080
How many times will I
check the guy she will marry?

1307
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,360
I won't let any
guy marry my daughter.

1308
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,120
And you're done forever, man.

1309
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,200
Your expiry date is long gone.

1310
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,440
- Telling me about my expiry date.
- Yes. You can drop dead any time...

1311
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,400
- Rahul!
- What are you doing?

1312
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,240
Leave him, Rahul.

1313
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,080
Whose expiry date has arrived?

1314
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,400
Yours.

1315
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,120
I am not scared of you.

1316
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,840
Wait, Manda.

1317
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,840
You think you won't
let her marry me.

1318
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,880
Your daughter's slept with me.

1319
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,880
Will you still stop me?

1320
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,720
Will you still stop me?

1321
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,360
Try stopping me.

1322
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,880
Satya. Satya.

1323
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:13,960
Shameless! I won't marry
you even if he says yes.

1324
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,040
What are you saying, Manda?

1325
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,320
And you're trying to
assert your right on me.

1326
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,920
What do you want to tell everyone?

1327
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,280
Listen, everyone!

1328
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,600
Yes...

1329
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,560
Yes, I slept with him!

1330
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,080
But I still won't marry him.

1331
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:36,960
Manda.

1332
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,720
He can forcefully take others lands.

1333
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,960
But he cannot take Manda.

1334
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,400
- Manda, I love...
- I hate you!

1335
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,080
If you'll try to forcefully take me,

1336
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,320
you'll only drag my dead body.

1337
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,120
- Manda, listen...
- Get lost.

1338
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,680
I said get lost.

1339
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,480
Take him away!

1340
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,480
Give me the flask!

1341
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,200
Yes.

1342
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,960
Rahul, Barkya went to the
IT Park to collect the money.

1343
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,200
Daya and Pitya shot
him and took the money.

1344
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,240
Barkya is dead.

1345
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,880
Soon it will be your turn, Rahul.

1346
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,160
Check properly.

1347
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,120
- Uday,
- Yes sir.

1348
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,360
this is better than a cockfight.

1349
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,960
These criminals
will kill each other,

1350
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,640
end of crime.

1351
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,320
What will we do?

1352
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,600
We'll only count the heads.

1353
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,160
- Padwal.
- Sir.

1354
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,720
- Note down these names.
- Yes, sir.

1355
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,680
Saurav Salvi.

1356
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,720
Vikas Sanap.

1357
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,800
Nilesh Jadhav.

1358
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,160
Raees Khan.

1359
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,560
Rahulya, Daya and Pitya
killed two more of your guys.

1360
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,040
"The world's an evil place
filled with evil thoughts."

1361
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,680
"Running after evil money,
shame on them."

1362
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,560
"Someone arrives as God
and controls your life."

1363
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,160
"It's so difficult here,
I talk to my own pain."

1364
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,400
"Kill him, kill him, I'll kill him.

1365
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,960
"I will bloody kill him."

1366
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,640
"I will bloody kill him."

1367
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,000
Daya, Rahulya killed
two of your boys.

1368
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,280
Did you finish the job?

1369
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,320
Yes, sir.

1370
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,360
Tea?

1371
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,800
- No, sir.
- We've to leave.

1372
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,120
"My heart burns and I carry
my passion in my arms."

1373
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,960
"I fight against death
in the path of death."

1374
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,760
"I live under fear and yet I dare."

1375
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,480
"My breath's filled with poison
and compromise with my dreams."

1376
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,320
"I won't endure any longer,
no more fear in my eyes."

1377
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,200
"What else can I say?
You strangle millions."

1378
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,240
"Kill him,
kill him, I will kill him."

1379
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,600
Sameer Dhonde.

1380
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,720
Agarwal sir, is the money ready?

1381
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,680
How many more of
you will we have to pay?

1382
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,000
Who else dared to ask you for money?

1383
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,920
Us.

1384
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,880
You're Rahul's sister.

1385
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,440
Yes, sir.

1386
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,680
What are you doing here?

1387
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,800
We're in dire straits sir.

1388
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,880
I wash clothes and plates here.

1389
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,840
The sister of Pune's new don,

1390
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,440
and working as a maid.

1391
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,680
I am proud of you and your father.

1392
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:01,360
If you ever need anything
then don't hesitate.

1393
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,960
Sir...

1394
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,520
Rahul.

1395
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,720
When those drops cool down,

1396
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,160
they fall on earth as raindrops.

1397
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,040
Understood?

1398
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:34,960
Haha...

1399
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,920
Thank God I am not too educated.

1400
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:37,520
Why?

1401
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,000
I would've lost my mind.

1402
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,120
Not you, the teacher
would've lost his mind.

1403
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,560
It's not that difficult, brother.
I'll teach you.

1404
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,640
- Yes.
- Please don't teach me anything.

1405
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,320
Rahulya, we know where Daya is.

1406
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,120
Why the...

1407
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,360
Where are you going, brother?

1408
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,640
Continue studying.

1409
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,640
I've to teach someone a lesson.

1410
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,880
"Brother-in-law was sleeping
on the roof."

1411
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:04,400
"I mistook him for you."

1412
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,320
"Forgive me Ranaji,"

1413
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,960
"I made a mistake."

1414
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:17,200
"I made a mistake."

1415
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,240
Run. Run.

1416
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,040
He's escaped.

1417
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,080
Nanavare sir.

1418
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,680
What are you doing here?

1419
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,120
Pitya's boys went to Makwana Jewellers,

1420
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,200
for extortion.

1421
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,480
He was with them.

1422
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:46,840
What am I hearing?

1423
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,520
Why did you go with those goons?

1424
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,600
I didn't know why they were going there.

1425
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,080
They are my friends.

1426
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,480
I went because they did.

1427
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,120
Friends.

1428
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,160
Friends.

1429
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,120
Friends.

1430
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,200
Friends.

1431
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,760
Where did you get this expensive phone?

1432
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,080
Brother Pitya gifted me.

1433
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,600
Brother Pitya gifted you!

1434
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,040
Brother Pitya gifted you!

1435
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,200
Do you have the money to buy this?

1436
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,480
Mother was sick and you
took her to a government hospital.

1437
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,720
Brother Pitya gave me money
and I took her to a private hospital.

1438
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,120
How dare you take money from gangsters?

1439
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,240
How dare you?

1440
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,840
Trying to show your father his place?

1441
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,200
What are you doing?

1442
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,480
What are you doing, Uday?

1443
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,680
If mother found out she
would've committed suicide.

1444
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,640
Do you know what he did?

1445
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,120
I heard everything.

1446
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,800
Sit son, give him some water.

1447
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,920
- Padwal.
- Sir.

1448
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,280
Call Pitya.

1449
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,320
Right, sir.

1450
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,480
Tell him orders are out for his encounter.

1451
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,520
Okay, sir.

1452
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,720
Constable Padwal speaking.

1453
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,120
Orders are out for your encounter.

1454
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,000
Within 24 hours your game's up.

1455
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,320
What did he say?

1456
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,680
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1457
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,120
Sir...

1458
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,640
Sir...

1459
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,680
Pitya is here. Pitya is here.

1460
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:03,960
What Pitya?

1461
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,080
Please save me, sir. Please save me.

1462
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,280
What brings you here?

1463
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,480
Padwal called saying there's
an order for my encounter.

1464
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,080
That guy Patwardhan whom you shot,

1465
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,160
turned out to be the
Home Minister's relative.

1466
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,760
I made a mistake, sir.

1467
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,800
I'll pay whatever is required.

1468
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,560
I beg you, sir. Save me.

1469
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:24,000
This is not my case, it's Uday's.

1470
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:24,640
Uday.

1471
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,440
Uday...

1472
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,800
Uday...
We're from the same village.

1473
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,640
Please save me.

1474
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,680
- I'll do whatever you want.
- See...

1475
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,880
Please. Please.

1476
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,520
- He's your hero?
- Save me, Uday.

1477
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,600
Kick him.

1478
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,240
No, sir.

1479
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:43,040
If you don't kick him then
your father will shoot him.

1480
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,880
No.

1481
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,720
Not here,
Uday, outside the Police station.

1482
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,600
What are you saying, brother?

1483
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,080
Don't do it.

1484
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,120
I beg you.

1485
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,040
Kick him. His life is in your kick.

1486
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:54,880
Kick me, Arun.

1487
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,840
What are you waiting for?

1488
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,160
Kick me. Kick me. Kick me.

1489
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,800
His life depends on it, Arun.

1490
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,360
Kick him hard.

1491
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,520
What are you waiting for?

1492
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,600
You listen to me, don't you?

1493
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,480
Kick me hard.

1494
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,360
Kick me. Kick me. Kick me.

1495
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,440
He saved your life.

1496
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:11,920
Thank you, sir.

1497
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
As I said this is not my case,

1498
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,000
it's Uday's case

1499
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,480
Thank you, Uday...

1500
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,000
Sorry... thank you...

1501
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,400
Sorry, sir.

1502
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,480
You got slapped seven times
by a Policeman.

1503
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:39,920
But you didn't budge.

1504
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,520
He's your hero.

1505
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,920
One slap and he peed in his pants.

1506
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,440
Sorry, father.

1507
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,840
I made a mistake.
I won't do it again.

1508
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,880
Here's your phone.

1509
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,200
Sorry, father.

1510
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,000
Forgive me.

1511
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,760
Uday, continue this at home.

1512
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,080
We've a job to do.

1513
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,080
- Boss...
- Who is it?

1514
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,040
Pakya.

1515
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,880
Pick it up and put it on speaker.

1516
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,240
Yes, Pakya.

1517
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,480
Boss, I came to pick
up Siddhu from school.

1518
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,880
But Siddhu isn't in school.

1519
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,400
What do you mean?

1520
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:28,840
I mean I looked everywhere
but he isn't here.

1521
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,160
Find him, Pakya!

1522
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,960
I will kill you if you don't find him!

1523
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,680
- Pitya.
- Sir.

1524
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,280
What are you doing here?

1525
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,520
- Craving for some sweets.
- Sweets?

1526
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,160
No, sir.

1527
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,440
Don't waste your time.

1528
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,800
Rahulya has grown too big.
Go after Rahulya.

1529
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,400
Sir, that boy is very close to Rahulya.

1530
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,560
If I get my hands on him,

1531
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,560
Rahulya will come crawling.

1532
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:13,400
That's the difference between
Rahul and you two fools.

1533
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,560
Even criminals have a code.

1534
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,560
They don't touch family and children.

1535
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,720
Get lost.

1536
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:23,520
Let's go.

1537
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,360
I couldn't find, Siddhu.

1538
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,320
What happened, Rahul?

1539
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,640
Ganya, I told you to
keep two boys with Siddhu.

1540
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:36,680
Didn't I tell you?

1541
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,200
But I told Pakya...

1542
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,600
If anything happens to him,
Ganya, I will kill you.

1543
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,600
But.

1544
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,160
Siddhu's here.

1545
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,520
Where were you? Where were you?

1546
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,560
It's your birthday, I went to get a cake.

1547
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,440
Oh yes, Rahul, we completely forgot.

1548
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,560
Next time if you go without telling me,

1549
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,880
I will kill you.

1550
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:56,280
Sorry.

1551
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,880
Go get ready, let's cut the cake together.

1552
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:02,360
Okay.

1553
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:03,080
Come on.

1554
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,040
- You must be hungry.
- Yes.

1555
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,080
Come.

1556
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,200
Oh wow, what brings you here today?

1557
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,840
Why? Scared?

1558
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,000
Me?

1559
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,520
Why would I be scared?

1560
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,640
Don't let anything happen to this child.

1561
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,440
Sir, I will set the world on
fire if anyone lays a finger on him.

1562
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,040
What is your relationship with him?

1563
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,040
Him?

1564
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,200
He's my life.

1565
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:39,520
He's got no parents,
even I don't have any parents.

1566
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:45,720
Who is that person who works
as a labour in the market yard?

1567
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:49,640
And the woman who cleans dishes in homes,

1568
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,960
who is she?

1569
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:54,840
Rahul, you're treating these farmers,

1570
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,680
just like Nanya treated your father.

1571
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,720
You've already destroyed your life,

1572
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,400
now you will destroy his life too.

1573
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,480
Don't worry, sir.

1574
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,320
I won't let him become a gangster like me.

1575
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:09,560
I will make him the
godfather of gangsters.

1576
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,440
A Policeman like you.

1577
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,880
And do you know what I will become?

1578
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,000
You know.

1579
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,080
CM.

1580
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,360
You've lost your mind.

1581
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:21,040
You really think you're plastic.

1582
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,000
You're plastic. The filth of this city.

1583
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,400
I've no regrets.

1584
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:29,440
Needless to say, I am going to rule.

1585
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,720
And one more thing,

1586
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,760
today this labour owns 300 acres.

1587
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,880
How much?

1588
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,560
300 acres?

1589
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:40,160
But who is ploughing these 300 acres?

1590
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,680
Your father? Your mother? Or your sister

1591
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,400
Even I was born in Maharashtra.

1592
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,760
And even I am the son of a farmer.

1593
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,840
Even my father's land
was snatched from him.

1594
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:58,120
But I didn't become a gangster like you.

1595
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,000
I became their godfather.

1596
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,840
A cop.

1597
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,120
To eradicate goons like you.

1598
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:15,440
Six months ago I bought only
one-acre land with my hard-earned money.

1599
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:21,600
My father works in
the field every morning.

1600
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,800
He's very happy.

1601
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,080
What about you?

1602
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,920
300 acres you claim?

1603
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,120
Tomorrow you'll have 600 acres,

1604
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,920
and later even 6000.

1605
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:44,360
But in the end, you'll only need 6x3.

1606
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,600
How much?

1607
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,480
6x3.

1608
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,080
Maharashtra's future CM.

1609
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,800
Who is it?

1610
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,160
Me.

1611
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,040
Rahulya brother.

1612
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,400
I had to come, Shinde.

1613
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,920
You should've called me instead.

1614
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I told you to buy Jadhav's
land for 20 million,

1615
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,320
but you didn't listen.

1616
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,880
What...can I do, Rahulya brother?

1617
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:28,440
The market's in a bad condition.

1618
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,320
- Sit. Sit.
- Yes...

1619
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:35,360
The market isn't bad,

1620
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,920
your intention is bad.

1621
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,840
I'll send him five million.

1622
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,400
Five for him and 10 for me.

1623
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:45,560
This is not the way,
we have given 25 first.

1624
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,480
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1625
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,160
- Happy birthday.
- It's okay.

1626
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,880
- Leave it.
- Happy birthday.

1627
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,160
Happy birthday, sir.

1628
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:06,080
Rajveer, how are you?

1629
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,520
All good, sir.

1630
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,400
How is Law and Order in Pune?

1631
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,200
Who would know better than you?

1632
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,280
But everything will be fine in the future.

1633
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,600
Because today's lawbreakers,

1634
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,240
will become protectors of the law.

1635
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,360
What do you mean?

1636
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,920
Today's Robin Hood,

1637
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,280
Tomorrow's MLA.

1638
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,840
Maybe the future CM.

1639
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,800
How much?

1640
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:51,920
10 million.

1641
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,520
40 more when we see Rahul's dead body.

1642
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,080
You'll see it soon.

1643
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:59,160
And I'll pay an extra 20.

1644
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,280
Constable Padwal speaking
from Market Yard Police Station.

1645
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,120
Yes.

1646
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:11,120
Shinde's offered 70 million
to Pitya for killing you.

1647
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:12,920
I see...

1648
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,200
Is the news confirmed?

1649
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,040
Yes, it's confirmed.

1650
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:21,760
What did he say?

1651
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,440
Cool as a cucumber.

1652
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:28,200
But sir, now Shinde's life is in danger.

1653
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,120
Hear him. Shinde's life is in danger.

1654
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,200
He's no saint either.

1655
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:36,640
This story began with Shinde,

1656
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,880
and Rahul is its last link.

1657
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,200
- Come on.
- What...

1658
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,800
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

1659
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,680
Rahulya brother, you're mistaken.

1660
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,200
You offered money to Pitya for killing me.

1661
01:37:59,280 --> 01:37:59,680
No...

1662
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,080
I know everything.

1663
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,080
It was a mistake.

1664
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:04,560
Please forgive me. Only once.

1665
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:08,040
I made a promise to you. Remember.

1666
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,920
- It was a mistake.
- Today I will fulfil it.

1667
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,720
Rahulya bhai.

1668
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,440
Ganya, take him away.

1669
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,800
- No, Rahulya bhai.
- Come on.

1670
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,200
Come on.

1671
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,440
Please forgive me.

1672
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,480
Please...I won't make
this mistake again.

1673
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,160
Please forgive me. Only once.

1674
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:24,600
I won't do it again.

1675
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,520
Please forgive me.

1676
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:30,080
Remember Shinde,
you said you'll tie me to the horses,

1677
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:33,120
and I said I'll tie to you a bull.

1678
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,640
In a pair.

1679
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,800
I bought them especially for you.

1680
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,720
Tie him up.

1681
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,760
No Rahulya brother. I'll return your land.

1682
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,560
Rahulya bhai.

1683
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,160
You took my father's land.

1684
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,080
You made him guard his own land,

1685
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,760
humiliated him.

1686
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:19,680
You're the reason my father,
mother, sister are not with me.

1687
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,960
I lost everything because of you.

1688
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:35,280
I will take this land back for my father.

1689
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:20,240
Remember Shinde,
I shed blood on this land.

1690
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,200
One day I will take it back.

1691
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,160
Ganya, take his thumb impression.

1692
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:33,080
Look Shinde. I took your land.

1693
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:39,240
I took it.
I took it. I took it. I took it.

1694
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:41,320
- Rahul, what are you doing?
- Leave him.

1695
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,200
- Rahul...
- Leave me, Ganya.

1696
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,960
Stay back or else I will kill you too.

1697
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,000
Rahulya, he's dead.

1698
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:08,520
Father! I got our land back!

1699
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,360
Father!

1700
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,800
I got my land back!

1701
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,920
I got it!

1702
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,640
I promised you, father.

1703
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:30,360
Dutta...

1704
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,240
Rahulya.

1705
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,480
Did you misdial my number?

1706
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,840
Father, I've some good news.

1707
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,840
I got our land back from Shinde.

1708
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,680
Look Rahulya,
that land belonged to my father.

1709
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:49,480
I sold that land for
cheap to protect my children.

1710
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:51,520
I'll never set foot on it again.

1711
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,280
Listen to me, father.

1712
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,640
Father.

1713
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,720
Here comes, Rahulya.

1714
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,200
Exactly.

1715
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,280
Talk to him directly, Maurya uncle.

1716
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:24,760
- All because of him.
- Yes.

1717
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:25,920
Yeah.

1718
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:26,880
You scored quiet high.

1719
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:27,760
Come, sit.

1720
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,360
Maurya uncle, all good?

1721
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,000
How can it be good?

1722
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,520
You want to snatch my means of living.

1723
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,560
What are you saying?

1724
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,640
Ganya, what did you tell him?

1725
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,000
I told him to sell his land.

1726
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,120
But he isn't listening.

1727
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,760
- Rahul. Leave it, let's talk business.
- Seriously.

1728
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,640
Look Maurya uncle,

1729
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:55,600
I'm losing 50 million
because of two-acre land.

1730
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,000
He's Mittal.

1731
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,720
He wants to start a factory there.

1732
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,240
Name your price.

1733
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,480
You'll do it.

1734
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:02,800
You're smart.

1735
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,080
What the...

1736
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:06,080
Rahul. Rahul.

1737
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,200
What's all the drama?

1738
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,840
What's so funny, huh?

1739
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:12,920
Now laugh.

1740
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:13,720
Now laugh.

1741
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,840
Rahul, what are you doing?

1742
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:15,800
Now laugh.

1743
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,200
Can't laugh now?

1744
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,880
Sorry, we know it's our fault.

1745
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:23,160
You see my son scored good
marks in his class 12 exams,

1746
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,800
and I didn't have to give
any donation for engineering as well.

1747
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,760
What else can make a father happy, son?

1748
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,040
But sorry...

1749
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,280
- Give him a sweet...come on.
- Give him.

1750
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:36,160
Sorry.

1751
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:37,680
Please.

1752
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,640
So Laugh.

1753
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,960
Ganya, we won't take Maurya uncle's land.

1754
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,360
We want this land.

1755
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:51,960
I'll get you another piece of land.

1756
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,600
Rahul, there's water behind his land.

1757
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,360
I said I'll get you another land,

1758
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,400
near the water.

1759
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,000
- Where are you going?
- Something's come up.

1760
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,040
I'll come along.

1761
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,240
I am not a child, understand.

1762
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,120
You don't have to follow me everywhere!

1763
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,240
No one will come after me!

1764
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,480
Brother Dutta...Rahul.

1765
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:30,760
Father, I need to talk to you.

1766
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,160
Speak.

1767
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,320
Father, nothing seems good without you.

1768
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,480
Not one bit without you guys.

1769
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,200
You left willingly.

1770
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:55,840
What will, father?

1771
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,080
I told you to come and live with me.

1772
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:05,840
Your house will reek of
dead bodies that you killed.

1773
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:13,280
After killing the Corporator
you had a chance to reform.

1774
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:21,440
But you were high on money, power.

1775
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:26,440
Father, will you come
back if I quit everything?

1776
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,680
No.

1777
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,080
Surrender to the Police.

1778
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,560
When you return after
serving time in jail,

1779
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:41,200
we'll happily accept you in our house.

1780
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,480
You know that's not possible, father.

1781
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:57,200
I promise I will quit everything.

1782
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,280
I am entering politics, father.

1783
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:08,240
A party is offering me
a ticket and I will win too.

1784
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:12,520
I want to see you and mother
smile like you two used to.

1785
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,360
Come live with me.

1786
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:16,280
I am lonely, father.

1787
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,880
Very lonely.

1788
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,600
Please smile for me, father.

1789
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,880
Our situation didn't
take away our smiles, Rahul.

1790
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,680
Your actions did.

1791
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,680
The day you cleanse your sins,

1792
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,640
I will smile.

1793
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,440
Can I eat now?

1794
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,720
I've a long day ahead of me.

1795
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:59,520
Here comes Rahulya the don.

1796
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,760
Rahul.

1797
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,720
On me. I won't charge you for it.

1798
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,160
I've some good news for you.

1799
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,400
Come here.

1800
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,800
Next week I am getting married.

1801
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,440
With him.

1802
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:37,760
And six months later
is my child's naming ceremony.

1803
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:41,200
Do drop by if you have time.

1804
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,480
He can't come.

1805
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:46,920
His expiry date has expired.

1806
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,400
Rahulya brother.

1807
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:58,920
Manda, you're looking
awesome in this sari.

1808
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:04,600
I will come if I am still alive

1809
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,760
Glory to Lord Ganesha.

1810
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,920
- Let's go to immersion duty.
- Yes, sir. Ready, sir.

1811
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:38,040
Why is this bad luck calling
on such an auspicious day?

1812
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:44,160
You see Rajveer, I called because
I've decided to do the Police's job today.

1813
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:45,320
Please do it.

1814
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,640
You just watch the fun.

1815
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,880
We will.

1816
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,760
We'll eradicate Rahul
and Ganya's entire gang.

1817
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:53,800
Please do.

1818
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,840
Don't stop us.

1819
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,080
We won't.

1820
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:57,440
Only enjoy.

1821
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:58,720
We'll enjoy it.

1822
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:01,600
Sir, we won't do anything?

1823
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,400
They think they are doing it.

1824
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,080
But Paaji's calling the shots.

1825
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:06,960
That's true.

1826
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:07,880
Come.

1827
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:08,760
Please, sir.

1828
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:11,320
Do you know where my journey began?

1829
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,040
Market yard.

1830
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:20,000
And you know,
this is where I lost my heart.

1831
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,320
Tea shop?

1832
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,280
Not the tea shop?

1833
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,160
The owner.

1834
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,320
Isn't she beautiful?

1835
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,920
Manda.

1836
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:50,960
I came to return your glasses.

1837
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,000
I kept them with me as your memory.

1838
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:58,360
But without you,
there is no memory.

1839
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:10,000
Brother,
there's no one there.

1840
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:17,480
She got married.

1841
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:21,080
Come with me.

1842
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:22,120
Where?

1843
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,880

Rahul.
What are you doing here?

1887
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,880
Is this my child?

1888
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:46,520
No.

01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,600
Is this my child?

01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,760
No.

1891
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:50,680
It's mine.

1892
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,520
Good.

1893
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:02,560
Manda,
everything I touched turned to dust.

1894
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:07,280
First my mother, then my father,

1895
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:11,120
now you left me too.

1896
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:17,600
Please forgive me, Manda.

1897
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,240
Forgive me.

1898
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:22,400
I made a big mistake.

1899
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,200
Brother, shall we go?

1900
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,200
We've to attend the immersion.

Ganya, I'm not coming.

Fine, go home.
I'll see you there.

He isn't coming.
He's going home.

1908
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:54,560
Okay.

1909
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,200
Rahul isn't coming here.

1910

- He's at home.
- Why that...

1911
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,120
Go and kill him in his house.

1912
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:02,280

He's done.

1928
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,520
I told you.

1929
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,440
When this Sardar loses it,

1930
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:54,960
everyone will be scared stiff.

1931
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,200

01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,760
Not completely.

1939

Not today, sir.

1958
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,000
Just give me a day.

1959
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:33,200
First I will perform
Ganya's cremation.

1960
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,520
Finish Pitya and Daya,

1961
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,800
and then you can even hang me.

1962
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:41,240
If I hadn't arrived on time,

1963
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:45,200
you wouldn't be alive for this crap.

1964
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:47,960
It's my luck that I'm alive.

1965
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:53,800
Go on, try your luck.

1966
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:12,760
Wait.

1967
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,320
Where are you going?

1968
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:23,560
Going to get some tea.
Do you want some?

1969
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:24,640
One for me too.

1970
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:30,720
Two cups of tea.

1971
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:36,880
Yes...

1972
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:37,840
We're here.

1973
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:40,200
Come on, they have arrived.

1974
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,400
Come on, let's go.

1975
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,000
Not now.

1976
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:32,800
Catch him. Catch him.

1977
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:38,480
Catch him. Catch him.
Come on, let's go.

1978
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,920
We won't spare him today.

1979
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:03,120
Hey!

1980
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:10,200
Hello.

1981
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:11,680
- Siddhu.
- Yes, brother.

1982
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:12,400
I'm in trouble.

1983
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:15,960
Listen, tell the boys outside
the house to come to the marketyard.

1984
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:16,480
Okay.

1985
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:17,440
Okay, brother.

1986
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:35,720
Look at the Mercedes.

1987
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:38,600
You can't pay for the damages
even if you sell yourself.

1988
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:41,400
Shinde, don't show off your money.

1989
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:44,160
Don't forget this
land once belonged to me.

1990
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,400
I paid money for it.

1991
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,120
We all know for what price.

1992
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,640
Stop it, Rahul.
I said it was my mistake.

1993
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,320
You had a chance to reform.

1994
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:56,520
We'll have half a meal,

1995
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:58,160
but make an honest living.

1996
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,360
I'll have a full square meal,

1997
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:02,760
and with a sweet dish.

1998
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:08,920
Your daughter slept with me.

1999
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:10,280
Listen, everyone.

2000
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:13,080
He can forcefully
snatch people's land,

2001
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,200
but not Manda.

2002
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:20,800
I've a list of monsters like you,

2003
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:24,160
who ended in their grave
before they could swear in.

2004
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,000
- Shoot him!
- Now he's your brother.

2005
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,800
When your own family deserts you,

2006
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:37,520
strangers become your kin.

2007
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,840
First, he will rape your
sister and then kill her.

2008
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,080
Out of the way everyone.

2009
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,080
Rahul.

2010
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,800
Look there.

2011
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,080
Move.

2012
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:20,720
Yes.

2013
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:22,560
Sir, Dutta Patil speaking
from the market yard.

2014
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:23,760
People are firing bullets here.

2015
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:25,680
Do something, sir.
Or Rahulya will die.

2016
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:28,320
Coming.

2017
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:38,960
"The world is dirty."

2018
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,240
"with bad intentions."

2019
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:45,640
"Someone will come."

2020
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:48,600
"instead of god."

2021
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:53,160
"My last is written by his hand."

2022
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:55,920
He's not over there.

2023
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,200
He's hiding somewhere here.
Find the rascal.

2024
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:05,920
Look here.

2025
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,720
Well Daya Pitya, game over.

2026
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:19,120
Sit over there.

2027
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:20,240
What for?

2028
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,800
We've a recording of Ganya's murder.

2029
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:23,680
That rascal Rahulya
is hiding somewhere here.

2030
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,000
We'll first kill
him and then come back.

2031
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,440
What will the Police do until then?

2032
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:29,760
Play marbles?

2033
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,120
You can do anything you want.

2034
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,240
Let's go.

2035
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:11,200
"The world is dirty."

2036
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:13,720
"with bad intentions."

2037
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:16,640
"Will kick hard,"

2038
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:19,960
"on the dirty."

2039
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:23,480
"Someone will come."

2040
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:26,400
"instead of god."

2041
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:32,680
"My last is written by his hand."

2042
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,360
Come on, get up.

2043
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:24,680
Get this dirt out of here.

2044
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,800
Come on.

2045
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,520
Come on.

2046
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,080
And what about you?

2047
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,760
Sir, I want to surrender myself.

2048
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:39,800
Right decision.

2049
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:44,600
Brother.

2050
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,280
What are you doing here, Siddhu?

2051
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:51,440
There's no need for it now.

2052
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:52,680
There is.

2053
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,600
Why?

2054
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:14,280
After mother died I swore
I'll kill you publicly.

2055
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:18,360
My name's Siddharth.

2056
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,240
Siddharth Maruti Kamble.

2057
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:28,640
Remember something.

2058
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:33,640
You did the right thing.

2059
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:58,880
- That's more like it.
- The mutt's dead.

2060
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:02,320
Hey cops, take us along now.

2061
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,360
We'll be out tomorrow.

2062
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,360
And we'll rule over
Maharashtra when we come out.

2063
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,360
Maharashtra isn't your property.

2064
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:17,800
Rahul.

2065
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:23,400
Father,
I didn't listen to you.

2066
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,960
Forgive me.

2067
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,200
Sir, I am different.

2068
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:43,600
I'll survive.

2069
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,360
Nothing lasts in this world,

2070
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:48,240
except for plastic.

Smile my father.

2075
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:18,120
Smile for my father.

2076
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,480
The day your sins are cleansed,

2077
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,480
I will smile again.
