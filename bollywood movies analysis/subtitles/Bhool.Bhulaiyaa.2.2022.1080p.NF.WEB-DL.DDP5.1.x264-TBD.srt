1
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,375
Daughter-in-law!

2
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,458
Daughter-in-law!

3
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,708
She is taking her!

4
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,416
Father!

5
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,208
Let go of me!

6
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,041
I will not leave until I seek revenge!

7
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,083
I will not leave!

8
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,583
Reet.

9
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,875
Let's go, my dear.

10
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,666
- Whose bag is it?
- What?

11
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,875
Someone left it behind. Hey.

12
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,041
It's a bomb!

13
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,708
It doesn't belong to any of us.

14
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,226
I am telling you,
there's a bomb in it.

15
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,250
Bomb!

16
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,708
Oh, God!

17
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,416
We can't even get out of here.

18
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Don't worry, Grandma.

19
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,041
- I've got your back.
- Back off!

20
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,416
- Move.
- Hey!

21
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,416
This bag doesn't have a bomb in it.

22
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,976
- This bag belongs to a bombshell.
- What?

23
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What is he saying?

24
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,666
Cowards!

25
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,875
- What's happened to him?
- Now watch me hug it.

26
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,791
- Hi.
- Thank you so much.

27
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:05,958
Thank you so so much.

28
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,875
Oh, come on.
You don't need to thank me, Reet.

29
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,041
How do you know my name?

30
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,375
Reet Rathore.

31
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,196
You are traveling to Chandigarh.

32
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,166
How do you know that?

33
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,375
I just know. I just know things.

34
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,166
You can call it sixth sense or…
sixth sense.

35
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,708
No, I didn't read that.

36
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,500
- Sure.
- I really do have a sixth sense.

37
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,958
By the way, I am Ruhaan Randhawa.

38
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,625
I am traveling to Delhi via Chandigarh.

39
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

40
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,541
Watch out, Auntie!

41
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,083
Reet!

42
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,458
Stalker much?

43
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,583
No, the phone...

44
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,458
Oh, so you want my phone number now!

45
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,330
- You are getting it all wrong.
- No, I got it right.

46
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,166
You think you stand a chance
because you helped me?

47
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,416
Reet, this phone...

48
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,708
To hell with your phone!

49
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,125
Are you a crackpot or what?

50
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,916
I am not a crackpot,

51
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,000
but your phone just cracked a "pop."

52
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,083
You left it back there.

53
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,208
What?!

54
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,125
Oh, shit!

55
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,148
Your family must be worried.
Here, talk to your sister-in-law.

56
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,541
How do you know about her?

57
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,458
Here, talk to her.

58
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,500
Hey, Reet. Where have you reached?

59
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I just took the bus.

60
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,125
Show some excitement,
you are getting married.

61
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,208
<i>Come on, sister-in-law!</i>

62
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,476
Did you really just send
me here to become a doctor

63
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,583
so that you could get me
married to any stranger?

64
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,916
Reet, Sagar is a very nice boy.

65
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,375
Yes, and consider yourself lucky.

66
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,666
Oh, really? If he is so nice,
why don't you marry him instead?

67
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,583
Okay. I will if you don't show up.

68
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,291
Come soon.

69
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,833
Everyone is waiting for you.

70
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,250
Bye.

71
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,958
You can get someone better than Sagar.

72
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,833
You still don't believe
that I have a sixth sense?!

73
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,416
Here you go then.

74
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,083
You are from Raj as than.

75
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,666
Your father's name
is Thakur Vijender Singh.

76
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,541
You have been here for four years

77
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,375
studying MBBS at a medical college.

78
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,125
- Awesome.
- I know, right?

79
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,791
You really do have a sixth sense.

80
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
That's amazing.

81
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,083
Can I also try?

82
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,750
You are Ruhaan Randhawa.

83
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,166
The only child of late business
tycoon Ratan Randhawa.

84
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,625
You are from Delhi.

85
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,416
Education from The Doon School.

86
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,625
Currently unemployed.

87
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,083
Right?

88
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,890
You too have a Facebook
account, you know?

89
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,243
This is where you got all
that information from, right?

90
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,541
Here.

91
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,726
My relationship status is single
on Facebook, you know?

92
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,458
The bus will stop here for 20 minutes.

93
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,625
I've been on the road
ever since my parents died.

94
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,333
I went to Gujarat
last month to fly a kite.

95
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,508
Before that, I went
to Banaras to have a <i>paan.</i>

96
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,208
You are mad.

97
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,250
This is how one should live life, Reet.

98
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,583
Just pack your bags
and go globe-trotting.

99
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,666
Live in the moment.

100
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,348
Tell me something, which is
the place that you liked the most here?

101
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,500
I spent the last four years traveling back
and forth between college and the hostel.

102
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,708
Why?

103
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,208
Well, my dad is quite strict.

104
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,333
He wasn't even ready to send me here.

105
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,791
He agreed only on the condition
that all I'd do here is study.

106
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,416
That's why I kept traveling back and forth

107
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,291
between college and the hostel.

108
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,976
Even if you mind, can I say something?

109
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,833
Sure.

110
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,166
You are either too naive…

111
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,625
Or you think I am that.

112
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,125
That?

113
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,875
The word that shall not be used.

114
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,250
It starts with a C.

115
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:04,875
Con man?

116
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,166
Never mind. You <i>are</i> naive.

117
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,833
Reet, now don't tell me

118
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,375
that you didn't even attend
the famous music festival here.

119
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,458
You didn't?!

120
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,333
I am not mad, you are mad.

121
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:20,750
Come on.

122
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,833
You have to attend
that festival with me.

123
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:23,916
Let's go!

124
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,750
The bus is leaving! Let's go!
Hurry up!

125
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,833
- Let's go.
- Come on!

126
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,791
Reet…

127
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,041
This isn't the only bus
that goes to Chandigarh.

128
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,666
We will take the evening bus.

129
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,645
You'll have to wait at the airport
for a couple of hours anyway.

130
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,958
Let's utilize that time here instead.

131
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,458
You have wasted four years.

132
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,500
I am sure you can spare
four hours for yourself!

133
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What do you say?

134
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,666
Geet!

135
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,916
Reet!

136
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,666
<i>You take away all our sufferings.</i>

137
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,625
<i>You are bountiful.</i>

138
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,625
<i>Both, the rich and the poor
Are your supplicants.</i>

139
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,625
<i>We have mixed a Hindi poetry
With English pop music.</i>

140
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,833
<i>This song's got swag
With a touch of devotion to it.</i>

141
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,916
<i>My lonely heart pleads.</i>

142
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,875
<i>When will I find the dream girl I seek?</i>

143
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,041
<i>Help me find what I seek.</i>

144
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:03,791
<i>O the one who sets
Everything right for her devotees.</i>

145
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,791
<i>You have always been true to your words.</i>

146
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,833
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

147
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,916
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

148
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,000
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

149
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,000
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

150
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,976
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

151
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,083
<i>You have always been true to your words.</i>

152
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,291
<i>Some want hot bombshells.</i>

153
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,333
<i>Some want selfie queens</i>

154
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:45,583
<i>I just want something
That grows gradually</i>

155
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,416
<i>I just want everlasting love.</i>

156
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,916
<i>Someone with intoxicating eyes.</i>

157
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,041
<i>Someone as beautiful as the moon.</i>

158
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,916
<i>Introduce me to such a girl.</i>

159
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,750
<i>O the one who changes
Everyone's fate for good.</i>

160
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,791
<i>You have always been true to your words.</i>

161
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,875
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

162
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,666
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

163
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,875
<i>You have always been true to your words.</i>

164
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,166
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

165
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

166
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,166
<i>I have already lost my mind.</i>

167
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,208
<i>Why are you making me
Lose my good intentions?</i>

168
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,333
<i>Your lovers are rowdies, it's true.</i>

169
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,375
<i>Don't assume that I am fake too</i>

170
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,250
<i>I do rap and not Qawali.</i>

171
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,750
<i>You are always true to your words.</i>

172
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,208
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

173
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,851
<i>Everyone, give a huge round
Of applause for this girl.</i>

174
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,083
<i>You are always true to your words.</i>

175
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,750
She isn't answering the phone.

176
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,916
Please tell us, sir.

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,916
We will tell you everything we know.

178
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,291
You should go and talk to them.

179
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,875
What is going on, sir?

180
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,541
The 02:30 p.m. bus en route
to Chandigarh met with an accident.

181
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,870
The bus fell down the gorge.

182
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,875
That's the bus we
were supposed to be on.

183
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,875
Thank God you didn't take that bus.

184
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,458
None of the passengers
on that bus survived.

185
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,875
Find it.

186
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,041
Hello?

187
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,750
Hello?

188
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,541
I can't hear you. Hello?

189
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,500
Hello, Trisha!

190
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,875
Trisha? I can hear you!

191
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,458
How did this happen, Sagar?

192
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:44,041
I used to pray to God every day that
your marriage with Reet gets called off

193
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,666
so that we could be together.

194
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,958
<i>I never thought that this is how
God would answer my prayers.</i>

195
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,083
<i>Reet is gone because of me, Sagar.</i>

196
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,791
It is not your fault.

197
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,666
Reet,

198
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,041
at least, now, your sister can marry…

199
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,416
Your fiancé.

200
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,250
- She cannot.
- Why not?

201
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,041
If I go home, Dad will
make sure that I get married.

202
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,125
For real?

203
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,833
Wedding invites have already been sent.

204
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,677
Everyone in the city knows that
I am supposed to get married to Sagar.

205
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,458
Changing the bride at the last minute
will ruin our reputation.

206
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,833
And my father can tolerate
anything but that.

207
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,386
He'll make sure that
I get married to Sagar.

208
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,750
So, what will you do now?

209
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,875
I will have to hide the fact from
my family that I am alive, Ruhaan.

210
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,041
Only then do they stand
a chance to get married.

211
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,583
So, according to your family,
you'll be dead forever?

212
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
No.

213
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:57,666
I can tell them the truth
once they get married.

214
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,375
What about Hitler…

215
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,875
I mean, your father?

216
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,541
You think he'll forgive you
once he learns the truth?

217
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,791
Perhaps not.

218
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,196
He might sever all ties with me.

219
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,460
But at least, my sister will be able
to settle down with the one she loves.

220
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,791
You are such a nice person.

221
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,500
I wonder what my family must be going
through after hearing about my death!

222
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,250
I cannot even go in front of them.

223
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,125
But you…

224
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,250
Ruhaan, will you come with me?

225
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,333
Death, funeral, crying, and wailing?

226
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,309
Why are you getting me into this mess?

227
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,875
Look, Ruhaan, you are not
going back home anyway.

228
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,000
You plan to wander around.

229
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,000
So, why not go to Bhawanigarh with me!

230
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,708
Bhaw... Bhawanigarh?

231
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,684
You can go to Gujarat to fly a kite,
you can go to Banaras to have a <i>paan,</i>

232
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,500
but you cannot go
to Raj as than to help a girl?!

233
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,541
You know, our <i>dal bati churma</i>
is quite famous.

234
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,541
Really?

235
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,875
I've never had it.

236
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,875
Oh my, such a romantic place!

237
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,291
This is your house?!

238
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,375
Where are you going?

239
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,375
Don't go inside, everyone
will recognize you.

240
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,083
Stop! Someone will see you, Reet!

241
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,041
Reet!

242
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,500
This used to be my home.

243
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,566
This is where I spent my childhood.

244
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,250
No one comes here anymore.

245
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,833
This is the safest place to hide.

246
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,458
Come on.

247
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,666
Even if you mind,
can I say something?

248
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,875
Sure.

249
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,041
It's quite spooky.

250
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,791
That it is.

251
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,791
Villagers think it is haunted.

252
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,416
Haunted?!

253
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,166
They say it is haunted
by Manjulika's spirit.

254
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:03,166
She used to sing,
"Oh, my beloved, listen."

255
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,708
Spirit?

256
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,583
Oh, look!

257
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,125
It's locked.

258
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,625
We can't go inside.

259
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,041
Let's leave. Come.

260
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,166
How did that happen?

261
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,083
It's old and rusty.
It must have fallen off.

262
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,833
And this?

263
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,333
It's quite windy out here.

264
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,851
Winds must have opened it. Let's go.

265
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,875
It's windy?

266
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,625
You are scared.

267
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,791
Scared? Who, me?

268
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,245
- Clack bat!
- What happened?

269
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,375
- A clack bat!
- What?

270
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,916
A black cat!

271
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,375
Let's go.

272
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,541
Come on, Ruhaan!

273
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,485
You're a modern guy, how can
you possibly believe in ghosts?

274
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,625
No.

275
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,208
I don't believe in them.

276
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,541
They aren't trustworthy at all.

277
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,458
Whenever they see someone alive,

278
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,833
they kill them.

279
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,291
Reet?

280
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,791
I think…

281
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,333
Mika is in the lounge.

282
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,166
Mika?

283
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,708
I mean Manjulika.

284
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,500
Oh my God, lights!

285
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,333
Villages are known for power cuts,

286
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,416
not sudden power surges.

287
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,708
<i>Even in the unconscious.</i>

288
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,458
<i>Only I remember you.</i>

289
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
What the...

290
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,041
Thakur Saab!

291
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,458
Thakur Saab!

292
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,333
Catastrophe!

293
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,541
Catastrophe!

294
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,166
A disaster!

295
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,291
A disaster!

296
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,916
Past has been unearthed!

297
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,583
Who had a birth?

298
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,875
She just died.

299
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,791
Priest, he said past
has been unearthed.

300
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,875
What are you doing?

301
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,000
What happened, Chote Pandit?

302
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,125
The doors of the old
manor were open, sir.

303
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,541
And the lights were turned on.

304
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,500
- What?
- What?

305
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,250
How did it open?

306
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,000
I have spent some of the most
beautiful moments of my life here.

307
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,583
You know... Come here.

308
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,375
Dad used to push that swing for me.

309
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,416
Your dad is a swinger?

310
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,625
Father…

311
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,666
What if someone has
opened that door as well?

312
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,333
And this is where my sister-in-law
used to oil and massage my hair.

313
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,708
And my uncle and I used
to gambol over there.

314
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,208
What if someone rented it out by mistake?

315
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,958
Anyway, we'll learn
the truth soon enough.

316
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,156
You should have converted
it into a library, Thakur Saab.

317
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,708
Rajjo, Potlu, Auntie, Trisha…

318
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,458
Ruhaan, how I wish we could
all stay in this house once again!

319
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,208
If anyone sees me, we'll be in trouble.

320
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,250
Hide here!

321
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,708
Nice. It's well-maintained.

322
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,666
Who has maintained this manor?

323
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:26,958
Who are you?

324
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,083
What are you doing here?

325
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,458
Thakur Saab, I have a more
important question to ask.

326
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,291
Who are you?

327
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,416
What are you doing here?

328
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,000
Keep quiet, deaf guy.

329
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,916
I am Ruhaan, Uncle. I mean Thakur Saab.

330
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,916
I didn't come here on my own.

331
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,375
Reet brought me here.

332
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:42,833
Shit.

333
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,416
Reet?

334
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,166
Reet is dead.

335
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,791
Did her ghost bring you here?

336
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:50,916
Yes.

337
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,208
He is right.

338
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,583
Reet brought me here.
I mean her ghost brought me here.

339
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,416
Look, Uncle, I mean Thakur Saab,

340
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,666
I too wouldn't believe in me
if I were standing in your place.

341
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,708
But I am standing here, right?

342
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,583
I have a God's gift.

343
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,708
I can see dead people.

344
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:14,916
Oh, fish.

345
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,625
I am raised among ghosts. It's true.

346
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:21,500
In fact, instead of tring-tring, my house
phone rings like conjuring-conjuring.

347
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,791
Conjuring-conjuring?

348
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,083
Yes.

349
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,500
What are you doing? Hey!

350
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,166
Why are you...

351
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Who…

352
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,333
Who is this sweet boy?

353
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:38,458
This mongoose-faced man
is a devil in disguise, Uncle!

354
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
He is a liar!

355
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,083
Is he your son?

356
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,375
This is the right time
to confess if you are lying.

357
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,458
Otherwise, irrespective of whether
you can see ghosts or not,

358
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,250
no one on the face of the earth
will be able to see you anymore.

359
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,208
Why would I lie?

360
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,250
That swing over there…

361
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,208
You used to push it for Reet, right?

362
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,250
And sister-in-law,

363
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,666
you used to oil Reet's hair.

364
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,333
And you are… her uncle.

365
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,250
Right.

366
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,750
You used to gambol with
her when she was young.

367
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,333
Right?

368
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,958
Does any outsider know these things?

369
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,375
- No.
- No, right?

370
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,708
How do I know about them?

371
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,083
Reet told me about them.

372
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,291
Reet's ghost told me about them.

373
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,041
Look…

374
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,125
Reet was our life.

375
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,583
I hope you are not playing
with our feelings.

376
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,083
Sister-in-law,

377
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:53,958
I swear on my dead mother…

378
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,291
Reet is here.

379
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:04,750
Look, she is standing over there
and looking at all of you with love.

380
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,291
Where?

381
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,875
No, not on your left,

382
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,750
on your right.

383
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,500
- Reet is here?!
- Yes.

384
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,625
Why didn't Reet bring you home?
Why did she bring you to this manor?

385
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:20,708
Right, brother?

386
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,333
Good question.

387
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,500
The answer…

388
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,583
What?

389
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,375
I see.

390
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:32,083
Oh… okay.

391
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,041
Can you see her?

392
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,166
I can't see her.
Is she on our right or left?

393
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,810
Could you please dial it down a little?

394
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,208
Sorry.

395
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,541
Okay, I'll explain.

396
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:45,750
Reet is saying that
she loved this house.

397
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,458
And her last wish is…

398
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,500
To stay in this house with her family.

399
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,250
If we manage to fulfill her last wish,

400
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,416
then that poor girl will get salvation.

401
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,541
But Father, what about Manjulika?

402
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,916
She is confined to that room.

403
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,500
If this is what Reet wishes for,
then so be it.

404
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,750
Listen up, everyone!

405
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,708
Our whole family will stay here.

406
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,375
Get this place cleaned up.

407
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:20,416
Come with us.

408
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,291
I'll join you in a second, sister-in-law.

409
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,125
Hey, you two, don't just
stand there staring at my face!

410
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,000
- Get lost!
- Show some respect!

411
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,583
No, Uncle, I am not talking to you.

412
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,958
I am talking to the two spirits
standing behind you.

413
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,375
Come on, off you go.

414
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,583
We'll discuss that at the new manor.

415
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,750
- Go.
- No,

416
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,750
don't them to the new manor.

417
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,166
You should have your
discussion right here.

418
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,559
- Are you sure?
- See you tomorrow.

419
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,416
Sure?

420
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,750
As you wish.

421
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,000
Ruhaan, you've solved
the whole problem.

422
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,958
If you can convince
everyone to stay here,

423
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,583
then you can certainly convince
them to get Sagar married to Trisha.

424
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:07,583
Perfect.

425
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,958
You have to forgive me, madam.

426
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,208
I am leaving.

427
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,166
- They will kill me if they see you here.
- But...

428
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:15,416
No. Please… don't do this to me.

429
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,916
No one will see me here.

430
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,958
This manor has 15 corridors and 50 rooms.

431
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,333
I have many places to hide.

432
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,250
This manor is a labyrinth.

433
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,250
Labyrinth.

434
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,416
Labyrinth?

435
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,333
Hey, clean it properly!

436
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,684
- Hey, what are you doing?
- This has to be done today!

437
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:52,541
Yes.

438
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,416
Work faster. Brother
will be here any minute.

439
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,250
What is going on, Gulshan?

440
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,017
Why is it taking them
so long to clean this floor?

441
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,142
- I'll get...
- I'll check upstairs.

442
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,000
I'll get this done. Work faster.

443
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,791
Look at the state of this place.

444
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,250
No one pays attention to it.

445
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,416
There are dried leaves on the floor.

446
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,625
No one cleans up...

447
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,083
No need to clean up this place!

448
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,392
You must be the first girl in the world
to relish the food served at her funeral.

449
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,416
It's very tasty.

450
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:37,958
Ruhaan,

451
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,833
I don't want my family to be sad.

452
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,083
- If you...
- Okay.

453
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:46,031
So, you want me to go downstairs
and put up another show?

454
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,765
- Please.
- Truer words were never spoken,

455
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:51,236
a woman indeed doesn't leave
you alone even after she dies.

456
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,708
Then ask him.

457
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:56,833
Thakur Saab…

458
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,458
She died at a very young age.

459
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:00,541
She was so young.

460
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,000
And she was unmarried.

461
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:07,791
Ma'am, you will have to offer her
weight in silver as a donation.

462
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,250
For the magic.

463
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:14,166
Ma'am, how much did Reet weigh?

464
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,875
Around 45 kilos.

465
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,125
How much?

466
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Forty-five kilos.

467
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:25,333
Oh, no. That poor girl was dieting.

468
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:29,291
Bade Pandit, if only it had been
Thakur Saab instead of her…

469
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,916
We would have become rich.

470
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,208
He is healthy as a horse.

471
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,875
We were preparing for a wedding…

472
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,236
But we ended up having a funeral.

473
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,028
We will celebrate, sister-in-law.

474
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,583
We will have a wedding.

475
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,541
Trisha's wedding.

476
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:46,958
Trisha?

477
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,333
My first daughter just passed away.

478
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,601
How dare you talk about getting
my second daughter married!

479
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:53,666
- Exactly!
- Tell him!

480
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,750
Thakur Saab, this is Reet's last wish.

481
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,000
But wasn't her last wish to stay here?

482
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:04,666
That was her first last wish.
This is her second last wish.

483
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,208
Tell me about it.
She has a list of wishes.

484
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,875
Look, Reet wants you to carry
on with the wedding as scheduled.

485
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:16,333
Get done with the henna
ceremony and the engagement,

486
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,125
and have the wedding
on the scheduled day.

487
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,416
The only difference…

488
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,916
Will be that Trisha will be the bride,

489
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
instead of Reet.

490
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,208
This girl?!

491
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,258
- Get her married?!
- What do you say, Trisha?

492
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,041
Would you like to fulfill
your dead sister's last wish?

493
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,958
If this is what Reet wants.

494
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,750
Done.

495
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:38,916
What do you say, Sumit?

496
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,250
- Sagar.
- Right. Sagar?

497
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,291
I mean,

498
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,125
I…

499
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,291
Whatever...

500
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,059
If it's taking you so long to think,
then maybe we should call it off.

501
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,875
- Yes, call it off.
- No. I mean,

502
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:55,875
we should fulfill Reet's last wish.

503
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,403
This is the youth of our country.

504
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,041
How selfless!

505
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,625
This is wrong!

506
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,333
This is absolutely wrong.

507
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yes, Thakur Saab,

508
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,833
it is wrong.

509
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,083
But…

510
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:12,781
Reet? Why are you standing there?
Come and sit over here.

511
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,833
Why do you always
make her sit next to me?

512
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:20,708
Hang on a second. Kids shouldn't
interrupt when adults are talking.

513
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,083
Okay.

514
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,041
But Thakur Saab...

515
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,166
I see.

516
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:31,541
Thakur Saab, Reet says that she
wants to be happy with all of you.

517
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,025
She doesn't want you all to be sad.

518
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,000
Once she is happy,

519
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,041
she will take the shortcut to heaven.

520
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,458
There's a shortcut to heaven?!

521
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,875
It's a phrase, elephant...

522
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:46,625
An elephant never forgets.

523
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:48,083
It's a phrase.

524
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:51,591
You need to decide whether poor Reet
gets to attend the wedding or not.

525
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,458
Trisha and Sagar will get married.

526
00:32:58,375 --> 00:32:59,708
That's more like it, Thakur Saab.

527
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:00,791
One more thing,

528
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,625
her spirit is in peace
after hearing all this.

529
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,434
- So, cancel the donation drive.
- What!

530
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,833
Pack your stuff and leave.

531
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,041
- What!
- Go.

532
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,333
Bade Pandit…

533
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,166
He's a bigger rascal than you.

534
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,125
Omniscient, my foot!

535
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,500
Tell you what…

536
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,750
He's a bigger rascal than us.

537
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,500
Hey, Ruhaan!

538
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,875
- Yes, Uncle?
- Does Reet talk about me?

539
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,916
She always talks about you.

540
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,833
Really?

541
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:36,916
Yes.

542
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,208
- Look, there she is.
- Where?

543
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,833
Right in front of you.

544
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:43,166
- She wants to swirl with you.
- Really?

545
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,809
She has extended her hands.
Come on, hold her hands.

546
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,750
- Okay.
- A little to the right.

547
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,083
- Right.
- Okay.

548
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,000
She is holding them.

549
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,791
- She is?!
- She is holding them.

550
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:52,934
- Time to swirl.
- She's holding my hands.

551
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,750
- Oh, yes!
- Swirl. Yes, swirl.

552
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,166
- Are you having fun?
- Yes.

553
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,208
Oh, Reet, my child, how are you?

554
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,458
Are you enjoying yourself?

555
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,375
- Ruhaan.
- Yes?

556
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,875
Thank you so much, Ruhaan.

557
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,875
You know, I have been dieting
for two months for the wedding.

558
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,208
I had even purchased
an expensive dress for it.

559
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,291
I thought the dress would go to waste.

560
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,625
But another wedding will take
place here, all thanks to Reet.

561
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:18,791
She is over here.

562
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,291
Reet!

563
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,583
I wish I could hug you.

564
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:25,708
You can.

565
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:26,833
How?

566
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,500
I don't just talk to spirits.

567
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,565
Spirits can possess my body as well.

568
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:34,250
Shit, why did I say that!

569
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,541
It was a secret.

570
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,708
Reet can be in two places
at one time?!

571
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:49,916
Rajjo.

572
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,416
Reet?

573
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Rajjo.

574
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,958
Come, give me a tight hug.

575
00:34:58,791 --> 00:34:59,791
Reet?

576
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,333
You have never been
so affectionate toward me.

577
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:03,916
It's not just you.

578
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,934
I am feeling affectionate toward
all the females in the family.

579
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,458
I will meet everyone one by one.

580
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:12,583
Reet?

581
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:14,208
Reet?

582
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:15,916
Reet!

583
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What is it, kiddo?

584
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,416
Reet, you remember her?

585
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:21,708
It's Granny.

586
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,291
She too wants to give you a tight hug.

587
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,833
Reet?

588
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,583
- Granny?
- Yes.

589
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:32,833
Come, give me a hug.

590
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,517
You're going to join me in heaven
in a couple of days anyway.

591
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,250
- Let's hug over there, okay?
- No.

592
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,750
I am not going anywhere
until I complete a century.

593
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,125
Come, give me a hug.

594
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,791
It feels good, doesn't it?

595
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,916
Someone liked getting cozy with Rajjo.

596
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,701
She is the only attractive
thing in this haunted manor.

597
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,083
Let this poor guy have some fun.

598
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,416
Don't you feel ashamed of
taking advantage of her emotions?

599
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,250
I do.

600
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:05,416
That's why I am thinking
of making her my wife.

601
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:06,833
What?

602
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:07,916
Sister.

603
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:08,916
Sister?

604
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
My wife's sister.

605
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,166
Your sister, my wife's sister.

606
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:14,375
Ruhaan, I'll...

607
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,625
Hey!

608
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:17,458
Hide.

609
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,458
Welcome.

610
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,166
How come?

611
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,298
Ruhaan, there's something
we need to tell Reet.

612
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,583
That you two love each other, right?

613
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,041
She knows. She is smart.

614
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,392
- She knows everything.
- She knows?!

615
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:36,125
- Yes.
- How does she know?

616
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,583
The call…

617
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,083
The phone call?

618
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Shit.

619
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,666
I mean since yesterday.

620
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,000
You see, I am talking to a Bengali spirit,

621
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,642
so I've gained a Bengali accent.

622
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:52,083
Reet knows everything about you two
since the time she died yesterday.

623
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,583
She says she is very
happy for you two.

624
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,833
She says there is nothing more
important for her than your happiness.

625
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,916
Okay, now, get out.

626
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Thank you.

627
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Welcome.

628
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,083
Ruhaan.

629
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:02,625
Ruhaan?

630
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,541
What are you doing here?

631
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,250
Here…

632
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,833
I don't know, sister-in-law.

633
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,458
Listen to me very carefully, Ruhaan.

634
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,625
Come what may,

635
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:15,296
you should never go
anywhere close to this room.

636
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,625
You may have spoken to many spirits…

637
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,250
But Manjulika…

638
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,833
Manjulika is different, Ruhaan.

639
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:30,541
Let's go.

640
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,166
Triple role?

641
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,333
One, two, three?

642
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Hey!

643
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:50,791
- What is it?
- What is it?

644
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:54,833
I was enjoying a nice breakfast
when I spotted you under it.

645
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:55,916
What?

646
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,666
Why is your picture
in the newspaper?

647
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:01,208
What is this?
What does this mean, obi...

648
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,708
They have published my picture
because I can talk to spirits.

649
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,833
What about the others then?

650
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,625
Some of them are garlanded.

651
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:11,750
I had helped these spirits
communicate with their family.

652
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,500
How nice! You are quite famous!

653
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,833
Who is he?

654
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,583
The village chief.

655
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,873
What does he want from me?

656
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,041
My mother wants to meet you.

657
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:25,000
- Why?
- She wants to felicitate you.

658
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,000
They have kept a party in your honor.

659
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,166
Oh, there's a party?

660
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,875
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

661
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,916
Let's go meet your mother, Chief.

662
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,125
How are you, Grandma?

663
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:37,875
What is wrong with her?

664
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:38,958
Cancer.

665
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,041
Oh.

666
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:40,916
Since when?

667
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
For the last 80 years.

668
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,125
Eighty?

669
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,250
What is her age?

670
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:47,083
She is around 80, son.

671
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,780
So, she had it since childhood?!

672
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:50,833
She's a fighter.

673
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,333
They should make a documentary
on you, Grandma.

674
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,958
You know, they can
cure cancer these days.

675
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,208
Grandma?

676
00:40:58,875 --> 00:40:59,875
Hey, Grandma.

677
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,458
Priest, does she too have
a weak connection like you?

678
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,541
No, her connection is broken.

679
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,166
There is no network.

680
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,041
What do you mean?

681
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:12,958
She just passed away.

682
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,458
Then...

683
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:19,958
Why did you call me here?

684
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,666
To talk to her spirit.

685
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,166
You are omniscient.

686
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:24,375
Talk to her.

687
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,125
She was very stingy, Mr. Ruhaan.

688
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:32,041
She hid all our ancestral gold
and kicked the bucket.

689
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,125
We cannot talk to her dead body.

690
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,458
Call her spirit and ask where
she has hidden the gold.

691
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,000
- I cannot do it just like that.
- He is right.

692
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,166
He will need to cast spells
and chant mantras, sir.

693
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,500
Let them communicate in private.

694
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,458
Pay your respect and leave.

695
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,291
Let bygones be bygones.

696
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:49,833
Take your time, son.

697
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,041
I am fasting to ensure we pull this off.

698
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,875
I have kept a monkey
under that old hag's chair.

699
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:07,083
When the monkey laughs, Ruhaan will cry.

700
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,375
Grandma!

701
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,041
He found the gold!

702
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,583
He found the gold!

703
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,708
My gold! Good job, Mr. Ruhaan!

704
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:19,666
Wow! Give it to me!

705
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,125
I got my gold back.

706
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,291
He found the gold.

707
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:25,625
Congratulations.

708
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,833
It's a miracle!

709
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,291
He is not Ruhaan.

710
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:37,583
He is Rooh Baba.

711
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:38,708
Everyone, repeat after me.

712
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:41,625
- Hail Rooh Baba!
- Hail Rooh Baba!

713
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:43,500
- Hail Rooh Baba!
- Hail Rooh Baba!

714
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:44,809
- Hail Rooh Baba!
- Hail Rooh Baba!

715
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:45,833
One selfie, please.

716
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,458
Say it loudly.

717
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,151
- Hail Rooh Baba!
- Hail Rooh Baba!

718
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:54,625
Hail Rooh Baba!

719
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,708
These frivolous clothes
don't suit you, Baba.

720
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:04,708
So, I want you to accept this garb
as a gift from all the villagers.

721

Uncle?

00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,625
Neither of you will get the house.

The house will go to
the animal welfare department.

743

Uncle Chitramal is saying that
you two fight like dogs and cats.

744
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:04,101
So, it is better if the house is
transferred over to the animals.

745
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,500
- No!
- Don't say that, Rooh Baba!

00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:06,958
- Yeah.
- We are brothers.

747
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:09,041
- He's right.
- We will share the house, Rooh Baba.

We are good friends.

Rooh Baba, you have helped
everyone in the village,

772
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,791
but you are yet to communicate
with my wife Kalawati.

773
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:08,958
Hey, go away!

774
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,958
Always following me for no reason!

775
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,750
I cannot help you communicate
with Kalawati.

776
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:22,250
Because her soul has reincarnated.

777
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:23,750
What?

778
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,291
She is back?!

779
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,541
Where is she, Rooh Baba?

780
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,833

00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,458
This donkey is my wife?!

784
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,208
She was as dumb as a donkey

785
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:43,101
in her previous life as well
to have married a dumbo like you.

786
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:44,041
Try to recognize her.

787

You must have seen
someone else, Potlu.

829
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,375
No, she was there.

830
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
She is alive.

831
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:52,583
What?

832
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:00,916
Thakur Saab… Reet is alive.

833
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:02,541
Reet is alive?!

834
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:07,750
I mean children are a form of God
and that has been proven today.

835

Children, dogs,

836
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,458
and puppies can see spirits.

837
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:18,301
I've heard about dogs
being able to see them.

838
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,625
They have a clear conscience.

839
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,958
Are you a swine, Potlu?

840
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:25,625
What?

841
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,500
Are you sure, Potlu?

842
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:29,583
Yes.

843
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,666
Yes.

844

I so want to lift him.

845
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:35,833
But alas, he is quite heavy.

846
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,666
- Ruhaan?
- Yes?

847
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,791
Does God really dwell in me?

848
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:41,916
Don't you believe me?

849
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,833
Come, let me prove it to you.

850
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,416
Come with me.

851
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:48,875

Okay?

853
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:54,291
I am going to throw you down now,
but nothing will happen to you.

854
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,666
You will bounce right back.

855
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,083
- No.
- Listen, you little menace!

856
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:05,000
Do you know what I will do to you
if you ever see Reet again?

857
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:07,166
What will you do?

858
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,833
I will lock you in that room.

859
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,958
There you will get to see your aunt.

861
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:18,750
And what will she say?

862
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,708
"Oh, my beloved, listen."

863
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:24,791
I don't want to listen.
I won't see Reet.

864
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,155
I didn't see her earlier either.

865
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:48,708
Calm down.

866
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:49,875
Relax.

867
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:50,916
Okay, come.

868
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,375
Come.

869
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:55,750
Come on.

870
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:58,208
What?

871
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,333
Here's your Manjulika.

872
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,208
You get scared for no reason.

873
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:06,583
Oh, yeah?

874
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,059
Everyone believes that
there is a ghost in that room.

875
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:11,351
I am always worried about
what will happen if anyone sees you.

876
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:13,333
When I step outside
to clear my mind,

877
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:17,041
villagers drag me to the graveyard
to talk to the dead.

878
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,250
I really feel like leaving
this place for good.

879
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:21,958
Fine, you can leave.

880
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:25,333
I am really leaving, Reet.

881
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,041
Yes, I understand.

882
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:30,291
How long can we continue
with this drama anyway!

883
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:34,041
I will have to come in front of everyone
once Sagar and Trisha get married.

884
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,541
I understand.

885
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,500
Okay.

886
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,541
I will pack my bag and leave then.

887
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,513
- Are you sure I should leave?
- I am sure.

888
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,250
It's a final goodbye.

889
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,583
Take care.

890
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:50,291
You are such a liar.

891
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:53,625
Your words don't match your thoughts.

892
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,208
It is not your fault.

893
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,500
Our relationship began with a lie.

894
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:00,083
What lie?

895
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:01,791
The lie that you are dead.

896
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,291
The lie that I can
communicate with spirits.

897
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,750
Let's do one thing.

898
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:07,998
Let's tell each other some
more lies before I leave.

899
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,125
What do you mean?

900
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:10,416
Give me your hand.

901
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:14,208
Not like this. Flip it over.

902
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:15,458
Now, repeat after me.

903
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:16,916
We solemnly swear…

904
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:18,541
We solemnly swear…

905
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:21,458
- …that whatever we say.
- That whatever we say

906
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,833
-will be a complete lie,
-will be a complete lie,

907
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,708
- and nothing…
- and nothing…

908
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,583
- But a lie.
- But a lie.

909
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:34,000
I am not at all scared of Manjulika.

910
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:38,708
I too am sure that
Manjulika's ghost exists.

911
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:44,541
I am starting to hate you.

912
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:48,250
I don't like you at all.

913
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:53,416
I don't want to spend
another second with you.

914
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,125
I too want you to leave right now.

915
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:06,458
I have never seen a girl uglier
than you in my life.

916
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,791
If you hate me so much, then just say it.

917
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,125
Fine…

918
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,125
I hate you.

919
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:17,958
I hate you too.

920
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,916
<i>My behavior.</i>

921
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:46,458
<i>Why has it changed ever since I met you?</i>

922
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:49,416
<i>I am surprised.</i>

923
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:52,375
<i>Your presence.</i>

924
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,541
<i>Why does it keep me awake all night?</i>

925
00:53:56,625 --> 00:54:00,875
<i>I spend all night tossing and turning.</i>

926
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:07,958
<i>It feels like we are walking on clouds.</i>

927
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:13,083
<i>Why can't we walk on the ground anymore?</i>

928
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:18,291
<i>- Are we high on life?
- Are we high on life?</i>

929
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:24,791
<i>- Are we high on life?
- Are we high on life?</i>

930
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:38,250
<i>I didn't know.</i>

931
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,541
<i>There would ever come
A day I would fall in love.</i>

932
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:49,583
<i>But that was before</i>

933
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:52,333
<i>I met you</i>

934
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,500
<i>I desire.</i>

935
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,041
<i>Nothing much.</i>

936
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:02,833
<i>All I want is all your free time.</i>

937
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,541
<i>I am going crazy.</i>

938
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:10,208
<i>My heart is feeling restless.</i>

939
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:15,250
<i>Why can't I resolve this problem?</i>

940
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:20,541
<i>- Are we high on life?
- Are we high on life?</i>

941
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:26,833
<i>- Are we high on life?
- Are we high on life?</i>

942
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:43,291
Raj as than is famous for three things.

943
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,791
- Yeah.
- Deserts,

944
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,583
camels, and now, Rooh Baba.

945
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:53,833
You know your black Rooh Baba garb?

946
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:56,041
- Yes.
- Looks too good on you.

947
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:57,500
Come on, Uncle.

948
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:00,583
That is the only black
thing that is good.

949
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,416
All the other black things
are associated with bad things.

950
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:05,916
Black magic.

951
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:07,791
- Black magic?
- Yes.

952
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,333
That's what Manjulika used to do.

953
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:13,041
That…

954
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:18,625
I've been hearing about Manjulika
ever since I got here.

955
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:21,083
- Who is she?
- Here.

956
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:22,458
- Where?
- Right here.

957
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,083
She's trapped right here.

958
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:26,958
Careful there, Uncle.

959
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:28,708
Be careful.

960
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:30,833
She has taken over
the entire third floor.

961
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,291
- She has made the property rates fall...
- Careful, Uncle,

962
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,184
or you'll fall right into her lap.

963
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,291
No, I don't need to fear
when I have you next to me.

964
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:41,500
You can talk to spirits.

965
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:46,416
You should ask her what she wants.

966
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,083
What do you want?

967
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,101
- Let's go and ask her.
- Let's go.

968
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,958
- Coming to get you, Manju!
- Let's go.

969
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:53,416
Watch your step.

970
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,416
I will put an end
to Manjulika's story today.

971
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,666
- Just tell me…
- What?

972
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:02,375
If I should go inside
and bash her up or bring her out.

973
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:04,291
Bring her out, son. Bring her out.

974
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,708
It will make me happy.

975
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,416
I will give her a tight slap.

976
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,958
Who started the cooler?

977
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,041
Let's shut it down.

978
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:34,458
It shut down.

979
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:36,666
Who is it?

980
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,291
Ruhaan!

981
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:40,708
What are you doing?

982
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,375
Sorry, Thakur… Saab.

983
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,791
Have you two lost your mind?

984
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:46,166
I'd told you not to come here.

985
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,083
Sorry.

986
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:50,500
The spirit behind this door
is no ordinary spirit, Ruhaan.

987
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:56,625
It's Manjulika who can do black magic.

988
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,166
Manjulika.

989
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:30,166
<i>Many years ago…</i>

990
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,208
<i>My father was called here from Kolkata</i>

991
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,416
<i>to manage the accounts.</i>

992
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:41,250
<i>My twin sister, Manjulika,
and I came with him.</i>

993
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:45,833
<i>I am yours.</i>

994
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,000
<i>I am solely yours.</i>

995
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:53,916
<i>Oh, my beloved, listen.</i>

996
00:58:54,541 --> 00:59:00,250
<i>My desires will
Forever remain in the breeze.</i>

997
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,125
<i>My father was a maestro
of dance and music.</i>

998
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,125
Very good. It's a miracle.

999
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,208
<i>Manju would feel jealous</i>

1000
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:13,708
<i>whenever Dad showed affection
toward me or praised me.</i>

1001
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:17,083
<i>I didn't realize when her
jealously turned into hatred.</i>

1002
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:18,791
Let there be eternal peace.

1003
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:23,541
Manjulika?

1004
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:29,625
Manjulika!

1005
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,458
What have you been doing here?

1006
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:33,708
What are you doing?

1007
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,166
You are driving me mad!

1008
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,458
It will ruin everything!

1009
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:42,000
<i>We looked the same…</i>

1010
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,348
<i>But had completely
opposite personalities.</i>

1011
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,958
<i>Dad thought she would
eventually fall back in line.</i>

1012
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,541
<i>What we didn't know</i>

1013
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:56,375
<i>was that Manjulika's insanity
was growing with passing time.</i>

1014
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,291
<i>She preferred a different world.</i>

1015
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:01,083
<i>She was interested in
black magic, dark spells,</i>

1016
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:03,916
<i>and the dark world of the Aghoris.</i>

1017
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:04,000
<i>Manju loved Kunwar very much.</i>

1018
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,333
<i>She had started loving him.</i>

1019
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,541
- Sorry.
- I am so sorry.

1020
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:30,250
<i>Beloved, even after death.</i>

1021
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:34,541
<i>I will love you.</i>

1022
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,416
<i>In restlessness.</i>

1023
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:42,625
<i>My heart will seek you.</i>

1024
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:47,375
<i>Your voice plays in my heart.</i>

1025
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:51,541
<i>Your desires can be seen in my heart.</i>

1026
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:56,166
<i>Your voice can be heard in
The clinking of my bangles.</i>

1027
01:01:56,291 --> 01:02:00,500
<i>This separation always brings us closer.</i>

1028
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:05,333
<i>- Oh, my beloved!
- Oh, my beloved!</i>

1029
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,833
<i>- I am yours.
- I am yours.</i>

1030
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:16,916
<i>- I am solely yours.
- I am solely yours</i>

1031
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:20,125
<i>- I am yours.
- I am yours.</i>

1032
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,250
My son, Kunwar, likes your daughter.

1033
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:32,500
If you don't mind, I would like her
to be my daughter-in-law.

1034
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,000
Thank you very much.

1035
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,333
It will be a privilege.

1036
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:38,708
What are you doing?

1037
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
We are related now.

1038
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,333
Manjulika!

1039
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,791
What are you doing?

1040
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:13,708
I'd told you to stop all this.

1041
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:16,875
You want to use black magic
to kill your sister?

1042
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:20,083
Why didn't you die before
thinking about killing her!

1043
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:24,083
You should have never been born!

1044
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:29,166
I wish God had given me
just one daughter.

1045
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:33,166
I will not spare you.

1046
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,583
I will not spare you!

1047
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:03,666
It's a good thing that Anjulika
doesn't do black magic.

1048
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:08,250
Otherwise, you would have said,
"Anjulika is so good at doing black magic.

1049
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,005
Manjulika, you should
learn something from her."

1050
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:16,958
You always scolded me.

1051
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:19,458
You never loved me. Why?

1052
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,875
But I love you a lot, Dad.

1053
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,375
I love you so much.

1054
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:33,125
And I will do as you say.

1055
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,791
You wished that you had
just one daughter, right?

1056
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,916
Now onward, you will
have just one daughter.

1057
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:48,791
I promise.

1058
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,208
Manjulika!

1059
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:07,833
Manjulika, what are you doing?

1060
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,291
Manjulika, you...

1061
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,333
Manjulika! What are you doing?

1062
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:12,416
Manjulika!

1063
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:15,666
Manjulika, stop it!

1064
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,250
Anju.

1065
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:11,666
I killed my sister.

1066
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:13,583
I killed her.

1067
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:16,333
<i>But death didn't stop Manjulika.</i>

1068
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:25,916
<i>We called an exorcist before
Manjulika's spirit could hurt anyone else.</i>

1069
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,273
Manjulika is enduring the punishment

1070
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:55,083
for her sins in that room.

1071
01:08:56,916 --> 01:09:00,458
Call it our bad luck
or Manjulika's curse,

1072
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:05,041
but we have lost eight
family members since then.

1073
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:20,625
Uncle…

1074
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,791
Did you get them drunk
and take them to that room?

1075
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:25,416
Keep quiet.

1076
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,500
Ruhaan,

1077
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:29,041
would you still like to meet Manjulika?

1078
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:33,208
No, sister-in-law. I am not interested
in talking to such a disgusting woman.

1079
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:34,625
Not interested.

1080
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:50,541
I got to step out after so many days.

1081
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:51,666
Such a relief!

1082
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:55,208
I even made you try
the famous <i>dal bati churma.</i>

1083
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,041
Now, do you finally believe
that Manjulika doesn't exist?

1084
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,195
Can we talk about something
other than ghosts for a change?

1085
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,375
- Let's go. Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.

1086
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,833
Next time, we will ride a camel, okay?

1087
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:11,875
Reet is alive.

1088
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,250
He is not Rooh Baba, he is Liar Baba!

1089
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:17,916
She is not Kalawati. She is a donkey.

1090
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,208
I am such an idiot.

1091
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:21,958
I'd come to ask him if Nathu's dog

1092
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:24,833
is my deceased mother as
she always tries to bite me.

1093
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:27,333
I won't spare you, Rooh Baba.

1094
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,458
I'll go and inform the idiot…

1095
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:31,458
I mean Bade Pandit!

1096
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:34,125
Bade Pandit!

1097
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:40,625
- Our time will come!
- Our time will come!

1098
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:44,666
- Our time will come!
- Our time will come!

1099
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:48,500
- Our time will come!
- Our time will come!

1100
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:49,625
Thakur Saab!

1101
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,041
Thakur Saab!

1102
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:53,875
- Thakur Saab! Thakur Sa...
- He's over here.

1103
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,166
What is it, priest?

1104
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:57,500
- What's all this commotion about?
- Score?

1105
01:10:57,833 --> 01:10:59,916
Bangladesh won the hockey match.

1106
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,875
They won by 5-6.

1107
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:03,125
He is asking me for the score.

1108
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,208
Shut up, deaf guy.

1109
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:06,708
- We have news for you.
- Breaking news.

1110
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:07,916
What is the news?

1111
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,916
He is not a sage.

1112
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,791
I have checked his horoscope.

1113
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:13,291
- He is lying.
- Right.

1114
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,416
Thakur Saab, your daughter,
Reet, is alive.

1115
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,583
I swear on Goddess Bhawani!

1116
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:28,166
Then, who was playing with me before?

1117
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,125
I saw her.

1118
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:32,875
You can break my legs if I am lying.

1119
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:37,625
And if he is telling the truth, then
Ruhaan gets the same punishment.

1120
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,875
- Break his legs.
- Right.

1121
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:45,541
Priest, if you are telling the truth,
then I won't break his legs…

1122
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:50,125
I will behead him.

1123
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,541
Promise?

1124
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,125
He promised.

1125
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:56,416
Father…

1126
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:59,291
How can you doubt Ruhaan?

1127
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:02,166
He has nothing to fear
if he hasn't done anything wrong.

1128
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,666
Let them assure themselves.

1129
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:05,708
Search each and every room in the manor.

1130
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:07,375
Sure, you can frisk me.

1131
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,958
- Search the manor.
- Search the manor.

1132
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:11,559
- Okay.
- Search every courtyard and corridor!

1133
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:12,416
- We will!
- We will!

1134
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,517
Search every nook and corner!

1135
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:14,375
- We will!
- We will!

1136
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:15,458
Look for her everywhere!

1137
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,375
- We will!
- We will!

1138
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,458
We will find her!

1139
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,583
- We will!
- We will!

1140
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:27,125
Find her, my beloved…

1141
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,250
- My beloved.
- My beloved.

1142
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:31,625
Find her, my beloved…

1143
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:33,666
- My beloved.
- My beloved.

1144
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,000
Reet, run!

1145
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,291
Ruhaan!

1146
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:39,750
Calm down. It's okay.

1147
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,691
- No, let's go this way.
- Let's go.

1148
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:43,166
Search there!

1149
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,125
Did you find her?

1150
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:46,916
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

1151
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,750
Did you find her?

1152
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:50,541
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

1153
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:53,000
Today, we will find her anyhow.

1154
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:54,000
Let's go.

1155
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,416
Check upstairs!

1156
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,041
Let's go.

1157
01:12:58,333 --> 01:12:59,333
Thakur Saab.

1158
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,375
Look over there!

1159
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:06,916
There isn't anyone down here.

1160
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:08,958
Search upstairs.

1161
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:20,583
Don't worry, we will find her.

1162
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:21,791
Listen up, everybody.

1163
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:23,166
Let's go upstairs.

1164
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:27,541
You have nothing to fear
as long as I am with you.

1165
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:28,625
Follow me!

1166
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:31,000
We will find her.

1167
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:32,541
What is this?

1168
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:37,083
May Lord save us from evil!

1169
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:43,250
You don't need to fear anyone.
Follow me. Let's go upstairs.

1170
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,708
Look for her over there!

1171
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,750
Check every nook and corner!

1172
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,666
Today, Ruhaan will be beheaded!

1173
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:54,000
Listen up, everyone!

1174
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:18,125
- Search upstairs.
- Ruhaan.

1175
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,041
- Go, look up.
- Let's go.

1176
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,642
Now, there is just one way to escape them.

1177
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:22,875
- What?
- No one will search this room.

1178
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:23,958
Don't worry.

1179
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:25,416
What about Manjulika?

1180
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:26,541
She is just a myth.

1181
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,250
Just like our story,
her story is also a lie.

1182
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,625
- Let's go. We have no other option.
- No, Reet. Reet.

1183
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:34,333
- Don't...
- Check upstairs as well!

1184
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:36,916
- Open the door, Ruhaan.
- Ruhaan will be beheaded today.

1185
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Hurry up.

1186
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:05,916
We searched the entire manor, Thakur Saab.

1187
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,500
The three of us went right,
and the others went left.

1188
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:11,041
On the left, we saw...

1189
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:13,083
Enough of these complex equations, priest!

1190
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:14,416
Did you find Reet?

1191
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:15,541
Excrete?

1192
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,434
You seem to be a little wet
behind the ears.

1193
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:20,875
Under these circumstances,
just dump it out!

1194
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:24,416
So, you should ask, "Did you find her?"

1195
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,041
You will get us killed.
Just shut up and stand here.

1196
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:28,125
Priest!

1197
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:29,666
Where's Chote Pandit?

1198
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,708
He ran away.

1199
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:33,666
Tell me, did you find Reet?

1200
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:35,583
I am deaf.

1201
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,208
- He is talking to you.
- I...

1202
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:40,166
Thakur Saab,

1203
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:42,166
we searched the entire manor,

1204
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:45,583
except for Manjulika's room.

1205
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:48,791
I think…

1206
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:51,625
Reet is hiding there.

1207
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:58,708
Thakur Saab is smart.

1208
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:00,583
Do you also think that?

1209
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:08,883
Do you really think anyone would make
the mistake of opening that room?

1210
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:16,333
Forgive us for doubting you, Ruhaan.

1211
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,291
It's okay, sister-in-law.

1212
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:20,791
Thakur Saab,

1213
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:24,375
weren't you talking about
beheading someone,

1214
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,625
chopping off someone's legs,
or something?

1215
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:28,791
- He <i>was</i> talking about it.
- Yeah, wasn't he?

1216
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,250
- Yes.
- How does he plan to do it?

1217
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,375
Using a saw.

1218
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,750
So, where's the saw?

1219
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:33,875
At home.

1220
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:34,958
Go, get it.

1221
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,125
- Okay.
- Go, get it.

1222
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:37,958
Stop, you fool!

1223
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,583
We already have a dagger and a sword here.

1224
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:42,916
But women these days always want more.

1225
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,666
You are lucky to be that, Thakur Saab!

1226
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:46,750
Let's go.

1227
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:48,791
Move!

1228
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,166
I should have gone to <i>Bigg Boss</i> instead,

1229
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:56,666
where you, at least,
get paid for being humiliated.

1230
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:58,166
Yes. Bless us, God.

1231
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,125
Reet.

1232
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:25,833
Reet.

1233
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:38,666
<i>I am yours.</i>

1234
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:44,041
<i>I am solely yours.</i>

1235
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:49,000
<i>I am yours.</i>

1236
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:54,166
<i>My desires will forever remain.</i>

1237
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:59,083
<i>In the breeze.</i>

1238
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:03,583
<i>It will stay alive.</i>

1239
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:07,791
<i>Even after being destroyed.</i>

1240
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:23,750
<i>I am yours.</i>

1241
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:28,958
<i>I am solely yours.</i>

1242
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:32,666
<i>I am yours.</i>

1243
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:02,375
I am Manjulika!

1244
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,583
It is not my fault, Ms. Manju.
Please, forgive me.

1245
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,166
I came to this room by mistake, sister.
It is not my fault.

1246
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,583
Please forgive me. Please.

1247
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:16,000
I told you there is no ghost here.

1248
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,291
Manjulika doesn't exist.

1249
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,583
There is a limit to joking around.

1250
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:21,666
Oh, come on.

1251
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,250
I am sorry. Sorry.

1252
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,666
You are crazy.

1253
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:29,833
These clothes were lying there,
so I thought I should play a prank on you.

1254
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:32,125
Prank?

1255
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:33,916
I don't understand your pranks.

1256
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:37,416
By the way, you look quite cute
when you are scared.

1257
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:39,750
Wash your face.

1258
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:41,625
You look just as scary as Manjulika.

1259
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:46,541
There is no one out there. Let's go.

1260
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:14,208
<i>The boy goes jumping to the fair.</i>

1261
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:18,083
<i>But returns with
A punctured tire of his cycle.</i>

1262
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,750
Ruhaan!

1263
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,250
Ruhaan!

1264
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:31,333
Is Reet upset over something?

1265
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:34,291
- No.
- She is breaking things around the house.

1266
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,990
- She's breaking things?!
- Yes.

1267
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:38,916
- Hey!
- What just happened?

1268
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:41,500
She is here now.

1269
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,375
Manjulika.

1270
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:24,375
What was that?

1271
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:25,625
Reet?

1272
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,500
What are you doing, Reet?

1273
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,416
Are you crazy?

1274
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,125
Put those things down.

1275
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:32,958
Reet!

1276
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:35,833
Why are you disrupting the celebrations?

1277
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:36,958
Stop this nonsense!

1278
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:39,791
Thakur Saab, at least,
don't scold ghosts.

1279
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:42,666
I know what is wrong.

1280
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:44,166
What is wrong?

1281
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:46,750
We doubted you two yesterday.

1282
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:49,000
That's why Reet is upset.

1283
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:51,208
That's why. Right.

1284
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:53,041
- That's...
- For such a small thing?

1285
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,041
Reet, my child, forgive us. We are sorry.

1286
01:22:57,125 --> 01:23:00,583
Come on, let's hold hands and swirl.

1287
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:02,333
You will feel better.

1288
01:23:02,416 --> 01:23:03,291
Don't worry.

1289
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:05,041
I will cajole her in no time.

1290
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,833
Slow down, dear.

1291
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:13,166
Don't go so fast, Reet! Slow down!

1292
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:16,541
Reet, I said slow down! Reet!

1293
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:22,791
- Uncle?
- That hurts.

1294
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:24,041
Are you alright?

1295
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,833
Who plays like that?

1296
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,125
It seems like she is quite angry.

1297
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:31,000
Ask Reet not to be so upset over this.

1298
01:23:31,916 --> 01:23:33,666
I am doing that, Granny.

1299
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:34,833
Reet…

1300
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:36,291
Please don't be so upset.

1301
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,041
Please calm down.

1302
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:43,041
Stop it, will you?

1303
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:04,125
- Manjulika!
- Manjulika?!

1304
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:10,625
I mean, according to what I have read
about ghosts, this has to be Reet.

1305
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:16,333
If that is Reet, then how can we see her?

1306
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:20,500
That's because your heart too
is clean just like his.

1307
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,291
- Reet!
- What is it?

1308
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:23,375
Look at your granny.

1309
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,041
- Reet…
- Yes, everyone can see her.

1310
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,485
That's Reet. Everyone can see her.

1311
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:28,508
Doesn't it look like she's
gained some weight?

1312
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,750
Who would bother maintaining
their weight after dying!

1313
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,500
That is true.

1314
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:35,500
Hey, where did she go?

1315
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:37,250
Where did she disappear?

1316
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:39,833
She got upset because we called her fat.

1317
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:41,116
She was already in a bad mood.

1318
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:42,708
I'll go cajole her.

1319
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:44,416
Reet!

1320
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:46,583
Get out of my way! The show's over!

1321
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:47,666
Reet!

1322
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:53,708
Reet?

1323
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:56,208
Reet.

1324
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:58,791
Reet!

1325
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:04,541
Did Manjulika take her away?

1326
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:05,875
Ruhaan.

1327
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:12,496
Forget Manjulika,
I feel like <i>you</i> will kill me first.

1328
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:13,583
Where is my bag?

1329
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,950
Why do you start packing
your bags over trivial matters?

1330
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:19,083
Let's run away.

1331
01:25:19,166 --> 01:25:20,958
Ruhaan… we're Thakurs.

1332
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,750
We never run away from trouble.

1333
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:26,458
And we're Rand ha was.
We flee at the first sign of trouble.

1334
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:27,958
We cannot leave.

1335
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,583
We set Manjulika free.

1336
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:32,750
Everyone's life is in
danger because of us.

1337
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,273
And you know what the worst part is?

1338
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:36,208
No one knows that she has been set free.

1339
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:40,375
Okay, fine, you can leave if you want to.

1340
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:41,875
I am not leaving.

1341
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,208
Why did I have to fall for a Thakur?

1342
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:47,333
I should have fallen for a Gupta
or an Agarwal's daughter instead.

1343
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:56,916
This...

1344
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:27,916
Free.

1345
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,208
My mother was right.

1346
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:34,916
Wives do start looking like witches
after a couple of years.

1347
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,500
You do look like one.

1348
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:38,958
Really?

1349
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:40,333
In the flesh.

1350
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,041
You do have something witchy about you.

1351
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:46,041
She is indeed a witch.

1352
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:49,958
But look, Ruhaan managed
to turn my witchy wife into a donkey.

1353
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:51,601
Don't stand there in your birthday suit,
daughter-in-law.

1354
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:53,541
- Go inside!
- I am not your husband.

1355
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,791
Go away.

1356
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,625
- Leave!
- Leave that donkey alone.

1357
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:58,708
We have finally managed to fool Ruhaan.

1358
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,666
Didn't you see how scared he was?

1359
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:02,833
He is dying of cold?!

1360
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:04,791
He was scared!

1361
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,000
We have to scare him.

1362
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:11,291
We need to confirm whether Reet
is alive or Ruhaan is simply lying.

1363
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:13,375
Mind-blowing.

1364
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:14,750
Amazing.

1365
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:16,250
No, priest,

1366
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:18,583
you are amazing.

1367
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:20,916
I just walked backward.

1368
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:23,500
You are the one who made things fly.

1369
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:25,250
Like a Hollywood hero!

1370
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:26,166
I made things fly?

1371
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,666
- He did?
- Yes.

1372
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,309
I thought you were
behind that amazing feat.

1373
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:31,833
- Why would Mohanlal be here?
- He said amazing feat.

1374
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:33,000
Which police?

1375
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:34,083
Amazing!

1376
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,791
What's amazing is that Ruhaan
thinks Manjulika has been set free.

1377
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,000
You got it all wrong.

1378
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:43,208
Ruhaan thinks Manjulika
has been set free.

1379
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:46,125
Priest, it's time for some cow urine.

1380
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:47,208
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1381
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:50,708
- Yes.
- She thinks he made things fly.

1382
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:52,208
He cannot fly a thing.

1383
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:53,708
I didn't make anything fly.

1384
01:27:54,541 --> 01:27:55,958
Then, who made those things fly?

1385
01:27:57,583 --> 01:28:00,916
Is Manjulika really back?

1386
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:50,791
Sister-in-law?

1387
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:58,291
What happened?

1388
01:30:58,583 --> 01:30:59,583
Where is Reet?

1389
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,041
Reet?

1390
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,541
There she is. She's sitting
on the sofa there, look.

1391
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,666
I know that Reet is alive.

1392
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:08,000
The priest was telling the truth.

1393
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:10,916
You were hiding Reet in Manjulika's room.

1394
01:31:11,916 --> 01:31:12,916
Where is she?

1395
01:31:13,166 --> 01:31:14,875
He was lying, sister-in-law.

1396
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:18,166
Both, Chote Pandit and Bade Pandit,
keep spinning tales.

1397
01:31:18,666 --> 01:31:19,666
Don't believe them.

1398
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,250
Reet isn't here.

1399
01:31:24,416 --> 01:31:25,458
Sister-in-law.

1400
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:32,125
Reet?

1401
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:38,541
Reet!

1402
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,708
What is going on, Reet?

1403
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:44,833
Why did you lie?

1404
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:47,125
I'll tell you everything.

1405
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:53,958
Then, all of you thought
that he could talk to spirits.

1406
01:31:54,541 --> 01:31:56,083
What else could I do, sister-in-law?

1407
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:57,750
I had to do this for Trisha.

1408
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:00,583
You know what happened
because of that, don't you?

1409
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,708
Manjulika has been set free.

1410
01:32:03,291 --> 01:32:04,708
She attacked me!

1411
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:09,375
For 18 years,

1412
01:32:12,916 --> 01:32:14,541
I kept thinking…

1413
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:17,083
Of ways to kill you…

1414
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:21,958
Once I get out of there.

1415
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:27,500
But not so easily.

1416
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,583
Not so easily.

1417
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:36,541
Kunwar,

1418
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:39,333
you too have been trapped
in that body for 18 years.

1419
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:42,208
Come…

1420
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:44,500
let me set you free.

1421
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,375
My dearest sister Anjulika,

1422
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:57,666
Kunwar is showing some movement
after all these years.

1423
01:32:58,541 --> 01:32:59,666
Aren't you happy?

1424
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:03,333
Alright.

1425
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:06,083
I will leave him for now.

1426
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:11,208
I will kill all your family
members one by one.

1427
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:14,166
You will suffer.

1428
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
You will cry.

1429
01:33:17,791 --> 01:33:19,875
But you won't be able to save anyone.

1430
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:21,958
And in the end,

1431
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:24,625
you will meet your end.

1432
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:38,583
What should we do now?

1433
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,250
Disaster!

1434
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:43,111
This is an irremediable disaster!

1435
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:47,500
She has been trapped
in that room for 18 years.

1436
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:52,583
You have no idea how angry
and vindictive she must be feeling.

1437
01:33:53,958 --> 01:33:56,833
That banshee must have
become even more powerful now.

1438
01:33:57,291 --> 01:33:58,666
It won't be easy…

1439
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:01,083
To recapture her.

1440
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:03,625
There has to be a solution, Baba.

1441
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:07,583
Spirits are at their weakest
during a lunar eclipse.

1442
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:10,291
We can recapture her when that happens.

1443
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:13,375
Why do all banshees have
to be connected to lunar eclipses?

1444
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:17,958
Baba, he means, when
is the next lunar eclipse?

1445
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:19,625
After three days.

1446
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:20,875
Three days?

1447
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:24,458
Couldn't you wait for three days
to enter Manjulika's room?

1448
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:27,166
We would have sent her back right away.

1449
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:29,333
I am not worried about myself, Baba.

1450
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:31,041
- But my family...
- That's enough!

1451
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:36,625
I will keep chanting protective mantras
nonstop for three days.

1452
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:41,125
She won't be able to go anywhere
near you or your family.

1453
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:43,541
She won't be able to do anything.

1454
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,166
Anything at all!

1455
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,750
Potlu! Is someone coming?

1456
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:52,833
Go faster, Reet!

1457
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:54,041
This is fun!

1458
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,791
Reet, I too want to fly like him.

1459
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,666
Is your sage fake like the other sages?

1460
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:02,166
He was making tall claims.

1461
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:04,101
He said Manjulika won't be able
to come anywhere close to us.

1462
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:05,645
But here, she is playing with the kid!

1463
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:08,406
She isn't playing with him,
she is playing with our fears.

1464
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:12,541
- Uncle.
- What?

1465
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:14,208
Come here.

1466
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:16,601
Ruhaan, we no longer
need you for intermediation.

1467
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:18,559
Reet starts playing with us
on her own now. Look over there.

1468
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:20,333
That is not Reet, Uncle.

1469
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:21,416
Then who is it?

1470
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:22,875
Manjulika.

1471
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:25,125
- Manjulika?
- Yes.

1472
01:35:26,708 --> 01:35:27,541
Brother!

1473
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:29,333
- Manjulika has been set free!
- Hey, stop!

1474
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:30,416
Manjulika?!

1475
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:36,416
He is drunk.

1476
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,541
He is just kidding.

1477
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:42,101
- You want to go tell him everything?
- Yes.

1478
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:43,125
What will you tell him?

1479
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:44,500
That she came out because of you?

1480
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:46,000
Because of me? What do you mean?

1481
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:47,123
Of course, because of you.

1482
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:50,458
Who got drunk and told me
to open the door?

1483
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:52,625
Who asked me to remove the trident?

1484
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:53,750
I did…

1485
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:56,416
- But now, she'd better not hurt my child!
- Drunkard!

1486
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,666
Go easy, Dad. Manjulika can hear you.

1487
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:00,666
Oh, can she? Good for her.
Let her hear me.

1488
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:02,333
I haven't said anything wrong.

1489
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:06,458
Ms. Manjulika, please don't hurt Potlu.

1490
01:36:06,541 --> 01:36:09,083
Aunt Manjulika, kids should not
spend all their time playing.

1491
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:11,333
I still have a lot of homework to do.

1492
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:13,083
I don't want to fail school.

1493
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,541
Please put me down.

1494
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:15,458
Good.

1495
01:36:15,541 --> 01:36:17,083
Come down. Come down, my boy.

1496
01:36:17,166 --> 01:36:18,875
She let him go. Thank you.

1497
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,500
She let him go.

1498
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:23,625
She must be tired of holding him up.

1499
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:25,625
Potlu?

1500
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:26,000
It was just a dream. Thank God.

1501
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:27,833
What the...

1502
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:32,434
Sister-in-law, what are you doing here?

1503
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:35,083
Uncle is missing, Ruhaan.
We can't find him.

1504
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:38,333
Did Manjulika…

1505
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,125
I wonder where he is!

1506
01:38:48,291 --> 01:38:50,375
I think we will have
to inform brother about it.

1507
01:38:52,875 --> 01:38:55,666
Mom, I think Dad was taken by Manju...

1508
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:59,000
Manju. Right. Uncle was
talking to a girl called Manju.

1509
01:38:59,375 --> 01:39:00,375
I heard them.

1510
01:39:01,416 --> 01:39:03,291
- They were planning a rendezvous.
- What?

1511
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:08,041
I am so worried about him, and he is busy
being a spoiled man-about-town.

1512
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:10,392
He can go to hell for all I care.

1513
01:39:10,416 --> 01:39:12,333
- No, Mom. He...
- Where are you going?

1514
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:13,976
Look for him over there, sister-in-law.

1515
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,500
I'll take care of him. Come on.

1516
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,291
Did Manjulika adopt a dog?

1517
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,041
I guess, but her dog doesn't bite.

1518
01:39:30,083 --> 01:39:31,523
Why are you making me take the lead?

1519
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,500
Because he is your father.

1520
01:39:33,583 --> 01:39:35,543
You will have to be
the one to make the sacrifice.

1521
01:39:53,833 --> 01:39:54,833
Dad!

1522
01:39:57,416 --> 01:39:58,416
Dad!

1523
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:00,708
What is wrong?

1524
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:02,041
Why are you snoring like that?

1525
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:04,625
Uncle, why are you sleeping
on Manjulika's bed?

1526
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,583
She will possess you.

1527
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:12,583
This is the last place Manjulika
would want to be.

1528
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:13,666
Why?

1529
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:17,291
She spent 18 years
trapped in here, stupid.

1530
01:40:17,375 --> 01:40:19,250
- Eighteen years.
- So?

1531
01:40:19,333 --> 01:40:23,833
So, a prisoner will never want
to go back to his prison cell.

1532
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:27,500
Uncle, sister-in-law has already
made a plan with the exorcist.

1533
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:28,416
You have no reason to fear.

1534
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:32,916
She has never done anything right.
I don't trust her plans.

1535
01:40:33,375 --> 01:40:34,392
I am not getting out of here.

1536
01:40:34,416 --> 01:40:35,541
Come on, Uncle.

1537
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,458
Do as you please. I am leaving.

1538
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,230
You're leaving your father all alone?

1539
01:41:09,708 --> 01:41:11,208
What…

1540
01:41:11,958 --> 01:41:14,458
What was that?

1541
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:22,708
Hurry up and leave from here.

1542
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:57,958
<i>What have I done!</i>

1543
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:16,708
- Rooh Baba.
- Yes?

1544
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:19,541
You talk to spirits so easily,

1545
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:23,250
but it is so difficult
to convince you to talk to them.

1546
01:43:23,333 --> 01:43:25,125
- Hail Rooh Baba.
- Namaste, Baba.

1547
01:43:25,333 --> 01:43:27,125
- Yeah, whatever!
- Rooh Baba.

1548
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:28,208
Stop it.

1549
01:43:29,041 --> 01:43:31,833
We cannot get rid of our problem,
but you mother...

1550
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:33,166
- What?
- Your mother's spirit.

1551
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:35,476
You've brought me here to communicate
with your mother's spirit, right?

1552
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,875
- Yes, Rooh Baba.
- Wait, I will.

1553
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:38,666
Look…

1554
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:41,791
Your mother is relaxing on that tree.

1555
01:43:41,875 --> 01:43:43,791
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1556
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:44,958
I'll go talk to her.

1557
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:48,083
Auntie!

1558
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:50,125
After you passed away,

1559
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:51,958
your husband started drinking every day.

1560
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:54,291
You should ask him
to let go of his drinking habit.

1561
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:55,541
Don't let go.

1562
01:43:55,625 --> 01:43:56,916
Hold on tight.

1563
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:02,458
Remember, if I fall, you'll be dead.

1564
01:44:03,041 --> 01:44:04,791
You are a ghost.

1565
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:06,708
You can walk on any surface.

1566
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:08,541
That's what I am doing.

1567
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:10,750
Do you know how difficult this is?

1568
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:12,791
You have gained weight.

1569
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:15,083
You should take keto.

1570
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:19,250
Keep going.

1571
01:44:19,541 --> 01:44:24,625
Sister-in-law, pretend to be Manjulika
and scare Ruhaan,

1572
01:44:25,666 --> 01:44:28,416
so that he is forced to tell the truth.

1573
01:44:33,125 --> 01:44:35,958
Damn you! You broke my back!

1574
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:39,208
You need to seek revenge
from Ruhaan, not me.

1575
01:44:39,291 --> 01:44:40,291
Behind you.

1576
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,583
What? I too fell with you.

1577
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:45,083
Look behind you, deaf guy.

1578
01:44:45,166 --> 01:44:46,166
Look behind you.

1579
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:49,083
Oh, God.

1580
01:44:49,166 --> 01:44:50,166
He's behind me.

1581
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:51,333
Yes.

1582
01:44:52,416 --> 01:44:54,416
Rascals! You three have
been scaring everyone

1583
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:55,559
by pretending to be Manjulika?

1584
01:44:55,583 --> 01:44:56,958
No.

1585
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,375
It was them. I was just a helping hand.

1586
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:00,541
Priest.

1587
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:02,916
He is talking to you.

1588
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:05,833
Greetings, priest.

1589
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:07,684
Let's skip the formalities
and get straight to the point.

1590
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:08,833
- May I?
- Please.

1591
01:45:11,625 --> 01:45:14,041
- Acting!
- He's hitting my husband!

1592
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:16,458
He's hitting a priest!

1593
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:18,000
He is doomed to go to hell.

1594
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:20,583
You will get cursed
for hitting my husband!

1595
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:22,208
You will never get married!

1596
01:45:22,291 --> 01:45:23,976
- You will never have an heir!
- Stand straight.

1597
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I'm going to kick you.

1598
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:27,416
Your spirit will keep wandering around!

1599
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,583
- All the...
- Shut up.

1600
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,166
I get possessed by Goddess!

1601
01:45:35,833 --> 01:45:36,833
Stop!

1602
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:37,916
What are you doing?

1603
01:45:38,125 --> 01:45:39,416
Why you...

1604
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:40,708
Please help!

1605
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:06,583
You are not real.

1606
01:46:08,541 --> 01:46:10,181
You are just a figment of my imagination.

1607
01:46:26,333 --> 01:46:27,583
- Oh, Lord.
- Imagine.

1608
01:46:27,666 --> 01:46:29,958
- No one is good.
- Your wife is crying.

1609
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:33,083
- Because her husband was thrashed.
- Yeah.

1610
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:35,958
Go, get her.
Tell her she needs to go home.

1611
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:37,208
Okay.

1612
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:38,583
She had left food on the stove.

1613
01:46:38,666 --> 01:46:40,625
Yes. We were served
burnt food yesterday as well.

1614
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:41,916
She also needs to make rotis.

1615
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Oh, my!

1616
01:46:43,041 --> 01:46:44,041
Oh, no!

1617
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:45,416
Let's go home, sister-in-law.

1618
01:46:45,916 --> 01:46:47,726
You need to check on
the food you'd kept on the stove.

1619
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,833
Can you please make
some curry for me tomorrow?

1620
01:46:50,541 --> 01:46:51,708
My head is spinning...

1621
01:46:57,291 --> 01:46:58,291
Oh, God!

1622
01:47:05,666 --> 01:47:06,666
What happened?

1623
01:47:07,083 --> 01:47:08,392
Your sister-in-law refused
to come with you, didn't she?

1624
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,583
She is not my sister-in-law.

1625
01:47:10,416 --> 01:47:12,041
Don't you have house keys?

1626
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:13,666
She is not my sister-in-law.

1627
01:47:18,416 --> 01:47:20,750
What did you say to your brother-in-law?

1628
01:47:21,291 --> 01:47:24,083
It's quite common for people
like us to get thrashed like that.

1629
01:47:24,166 --> 01:47:25,375
Hey, Lajjo.

1630
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:28,916
Do not tell your family
that I got thrashed.

1631
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:31,767
Everyone gets a beating
at least once in their lifetime,

1632
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:33,166
it's just that no one reveals it.

1633
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:34,541
Anyway…

1634
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:36,833
Don't get upset over it.

1635
01:47:37,416 --> 01:47:38,416
Go, make some curry.

1636
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:43,541
Have you consumed cannabis, Lajjo?

1637
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:04,875
A camel somewhere wants water.

1638
01:48:05,375 --> 01:48:07,833
Last night was quite eventful, sister.

1639
01:48:11,166 --> 01:48:12,958
He was out of control.

1640
01:48:15,458 --> 01:48:17,291
Meenu's mother is pregnant again?!

1641
01:48:24,791 --> 01:48:25,791
Thank you.

1642
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,500
Thank you.

1643
01:48:29,291 --> 01:48:30,291
Thank you.

1644
01:48:30,416 --> 01:48:33,750
She is a doctor, bonehead!

1645
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:35,125
She is a bloody doctor!

1646
01:48:35,458 --> 01:48:37,083
- She is a doctor!
- Hey, priest!

1647
01:48:37,166 --> 01:48:40,250
Watch out. Have you turned blind too?
Come this way.

1648
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:42,250
Where to?

1649
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:44,375
Over there.

1650
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:45,458
What's over there?

1651
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:46,791
Ma…

1652
01:48:46,875 --> 01:48:47,708
Manjulika?

1653
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:48,666
Gho…

1654
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:50,125
- A ghost?
- Yes.

1655
01:48:50,208 --> 01:48:51,250
Hey, you two!

1656
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:53,333
- Yeah.
- Who could be scarier than you guys!

1657
01:48:53,416 --> 01:48:54,500
- She is!
- She is!

1658
01:48:54,708 --> 01:48:55,708
Oh!

1659
01:48:55,958 --> 01:48:57,333
Actually, it is my fault.

1660
01:48:57,875 --> 01:49:01,625
- I thrashed you two but not her.
- Yeah.

1661
01:49:01,708 --> 01:49:03,375
Come on, let's go and thrash her as well.

1662
01:49:03,458 --> 01:49:04,875
- No!
- Come with me.

1663
01:49:04,958 --> 01:49:06,333
- No!
- Come on!

1664
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:07,250
No…

1665
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:08,573
Fine, I'll go bash her up then.

1666
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:11,375
Let's go, hurry up.
Let's run away from the village.

1667
01:49:14,208 --> 01:49:15,208
Hey!

1668
01:49:15,875 --> 01:49:16,875
Hello!

1669
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:20,333
Hi.

1670
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:23,471
Even if you mind, can I ask you something?

1671
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:25,958
Why do you hide your face?

1672
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,791
What have you done that
you need to hide your face?

1673
01:49:34,125 --> 01:49:35,625
Actually, you are full of cliches.

1674
01:49:36,291 --> 01:49:38,500
Black clothes, white face,
and hair covering the face.

1675
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:40,708
Manjulika.

1676
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:44,208
How can you be Manjulika?

1677
01:49:44,666 --> 01:49:48,750
Donald Trump's tweets
and a witch's feet are always crooked.

1678
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:54,125
Oh, damn.

1679
01:50:07,958 --> 01:50:09,083
Oh, God!

1680
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:44,750
Did someone fall somewhere?
I think I heard something.

1681
01:50:46,375 --> 01:50:48,208
- Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Greetings.

1682
01:50:48,291 --> 01:50:50,416
Why does Mr. Kunwar always sit like that?

1683
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:53,583
Because Manjulika paid him a visit.

1684
01:50:53,666 --> 01:50:54,666
Oh, God!

1685
01:50:55,125 --> 01:50:57,333
Greetings, Thakur Saab.

1686
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:01,958
Oh, wow!
There's the picture-perfect family!

1687
01:51:02,083 --> 01:51:04,500
Greetings, priest. What brings you here?

1688
01:51:04,791 --> 01:51:07,500
We are here because we are leaving.

1689
01:51:08,041 --> 01:51:08,958
What do you mean?

1690
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:10,601
- Well...
- We are leaving this village.

1691
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:11,708
What happened?

1692
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:16,250
Looks like they don't know
that Manjulika has been set free.

1693
01:51:16,333 --> 01:51:20,000
They will get to know when
she comes and slaps them.

1694
01:51:20,083 --> 01:51:21,541
Why should we bother telling them?

1695
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:25,083
Stop whispering to each other.
Let's just get to the point.

1696
01:51:25,208 --> 01:51:29,541
Thakur Saab, you owe us some money
for the ritual we had performed.

1697
01:51:29,916 --> 01:51:31,416
- What?
- Yes.

1698
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:32,500
You owe us 64 rupees.

1699
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,666
You came here for 64 rupees?!

1700
01:51:34,791 --> 01:51:35,791
Yes, please.

1701
01:51:36,333 --> 01:51:37,916
- Give it to me.
- Here.

1702
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:47,583
The old hag gave me exactly 64 rupees.

1703
01:51:48,708 --> 01:51:51,268
Everyone, go get some rest.
We have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

1704
01:51:52,458 --> 01:51:55,083
- Right, we too will get going now.
- We too will get going now.

1705
01:51:55,541 --> 01:51:57,250
- Good night.
- Good night.

1706
01:51:58,125 --> 01:52:03,375
Love is such a rare
commodity these days.

1707
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:05,083
- Brother! Hey!
- Brother.

1708
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:06,916
- Come on...
- Hey!

1709
01:52:07,875 --> 01:52:08,875
Hey!

1710
01:52:10,625 --> 01:52:12,351
They are made of brass.
Should we steal them?

1711
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:14,416
No. Why would we steal brass articles?

1712
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:18,208
- Can't you see those silver utensils?
- Yes.

1713
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:21,500
We could've stolen a few more things
if you had brought a bigger bag.

1714
01:52:21,583 --> 01:52:24,458
We've kept a sack
out there. Let's get that.

1715
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:27,375
Forget the sack and get one
of the many trunks instead.

1716
01:52:27,458 --> 01:52:30,166
- Right. Quickly, go get one.
- Let's go.

1717
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,083
- Oh, God!
- What was that!

1718
01:52:33,708 --> 01:52:34,833
Oh, no!

1719
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:37,375
- What is going on?
- Oh, Lord!

1720
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:38,750
Another power cut?

1721
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:41,713
- Will it be safe to step out now?
- What if we bump into her once again?

1722
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,750
Right.

1723
01:52:42,833 --> 01:52:43,750
Right.

1724
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:46,458
- They are making an announcement.
<i>- …Is eight hours late.</i>

1725
01:52:46,541 --> 01:52:48,458
Our train is eight hours late.

1726
01:52:48,541 --> 01:52:49,458
Oh, God.

1727
01:52:49,541 --> 01:52:50,916
- We will leave at dawn.
- Yeah.

1728
01:52:51,125 --> 01:52:52,875
Let's sleep on the sofa.

1729
01:52:53,041 --> 01:52:55,083
- Excuse me? Can we have a lamp, please?
- Let's go.

1730
01:52:55,166 --> 01:52:57,486
We were just stealing a few things.
It would be convenient.

1731
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:28,083
<i>I am yours.</i>

1732
01:53:28,708 --> 01:53:33,041
<i>I am solely yours.</i>

1733
01:53:33,625 --> 01:53:37,833
<i>I am yours.</i>

1734
01:53:41,625 --> 01:53:45,000
<i>I am yours.</i>

1735
01:53:45,791 --> 01:53:49,500
<i>I am solely yours</i>

1736
01:53:49,875 --> 01:53:53,208
<i>I am yours.</i>

1737
01:53:53,791 --> 01:53:57,416
<i>My desires.</i>

1738
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:01,291
<i>Will forever remain in the breeze.</i>

1739
01:54:02,083 --> 01:54:05,875
<i>It will stay alive.</i>

1740
01:54:05,958 --> 01:54:10,875
<i>Even after being destroyed.</i>

1741
01:54:44,916 --> 01:54:49,291
<i>Your tunes are immersed.</i>

1742
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:52,958
<i>In my breath.</i>

1743
01:54:53,958 --> 01:54:58,000
<i>My life is nothing.</i>

1744
01:54:58,083 --> 01:55:01,166
<i>Without you.</i>

1745
01:55:01,416 --> 01:55:06,291
<i>Your tunes are immersed.</i>

1746
01:55:06,375 --> 01:55:09,791
<i>In my breath.</i>

1747
01:55:10,583 --> 01:55:14,500
<i>My life is nothing.</i>

1748
01:55:14,625 --> 01:55:17,791
<i>Without you.</i>

1749
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:21,833
<i>Your voice plays in my heart.</i>

1750
01:55:21,916 --> 01:55:25,916
<i>Your desires can be seen in my heart.</i>

1751
01:55:26,041 --> 01:55:30,083
<i>You are the only thing
I ever think about.</i>

1752
01:55:30,166 --> 01:55:34,291
<i>The moment of separation
Is very difficult.</i>

1753
01:55:34,375 --> 01:55:40,291
<i>Oh, my beloved!</i>

1754
01:55:49,833 --> 01:55:50,833
Ruhaan?

1755
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:53,875
Ruhaan?

1756
01:55:56,041 --> 01:55:57,041
Ruhaan!

1757
01:56:10,541 --> 01:56:11,541
Yes, sister-in-law?

1758
01:56:13,291 --> 01:56:14,531
Why were you singing that song?

1759
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,166
I just felt like singing it.

1760
01:56:19,583 --> 01:56:21,291
I love this song.

1761
01:56:23,541 --> 01:56:24,791
You know Bengali?

1762
01:56:25,333 --> 01:56:26,333
Very little.

1763
01:56:27,041 --> 01:56:28,333
- Ruhaan.
- Yes?

1764
01:56:29,166 --> 01:56:30,166
Are you alright?

1765
01:56:33,125 --> 01:56:34,125
Absolutely fine.

1766
01:56:34,625 --> 01:56:36,333
- How about you?
- Me?

1767
01:56:36,458 --> 01:56:37,458
Ruhaan…

1768
01:56:38,208 --> 01:56:40,041
It's quite late.
You should go to bed.

1769
01:56:40,416 --> 01:56:41,416
Okay.

1770
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,416
Good night.

1771
01:57:18,083 --> 01:57:19,083
Okay?

1772
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:46,500
Ruhaan!

1773
01:57:47,041 --> 01:57:48,041
What is wrong?

1774
01:57:49,125 --> 01:57:50,750
You guys are strange.

1775
01:57:51,083 --> 01:57:53,500
Why have you decorated
the house with flowers?

1776
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:54,916
There is a wedding tomorrow.

1777
01:57:55,375 --> 01:57:56,375
A wedding?

1778
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:58,940
How can there be a wedding tomorrow…

1779
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,520
If someone is going to die here today?

1780
01:58:04,875 --> 01:58:05,875
What?!

1781
01:58:06,083 --> 01:58:07,083
Yes.

1782
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:12,166
She is going to die.

1783
01:58:14,333 --> 01:58:15,333
I will kill her.

1784
01:58:15,416 --> 01:58:16,416
Ruhaan!

1785
01:58:21,166 --> 01:58:22,416
Didn't you tell everyone…

1786
01:58:23,541 --> 01:58:24,625
That I have been set free?

1787
01:58:27,416 --> 01:58:28,416
What is this nonsense?

1788
01:58:28,916 --> 01:58:30,000
Have you lost your mind?

1789
01:58:41,208 --> 01:58:42,458
You won't be spared this time!

1790
01:58:42,625 --> 01:58:43,625
I will not spare you!

1791
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:47,833
I am Manjulika!

1792
01:58:48,708 --> 01:58:49,958
Manjulika!

1793
01:58:50,041 --> 01:58:51,125
She is back!

1794
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:52,791
- She is back!
- Run!

1795
01:58:52,875 --> 01:58:54,916
Hey, stop! Open the door!

1796
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Oh, God!

1797
01:58:56,208 --> 01:58:58,125
She is back!

1798
01:59:06,833 --> 01:59:09,250
What are you staring at
with your eyes wide open?

1799
01:59:10,416 --> 01:59:15,333
Manjulika, my child, my Bengali
is just as good as my French.

1800
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:17,208
So, if you could translate that…

1801
01:59:17,291 --> 01:59:18,708
I want your blood!

1802
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:20,291
He is talking to you.

1803
01:59:20,375 --> 01:59:23,708
Sister, I have a vitamin deficiency.

1804
01:59:23,833 --> 01:59:26,041
Both of them suffer from diabetes.

1805
01:59:26,125 --> 01:59:27,833
Full diabetes.

1806
01:59:27,916 --> 01:59:29,208
Total useless.

1807
01:59:29,791 --> 01:59:32,041
Uncle is as fit as a fiddle.

1808
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:35,250
Uncle is trying to escape.

1809
01:59:39,125 --> 01:59:40,125
Reet.

1810
01:59:41,416 --> 01:59:42,416
Reet!

1811
01:59:42,916 --> 01:59:43,916
Brother!

1812
01:59:44,125 --> 01:59:45,125
Reet is here!

1813
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:48,916
She is here to save us!

1814
01:59:54,916 --> 01:59:56,250
Hey, Manjulika!

1815
01:59:56,833 --> 01:59:58,750
Yes. Actually, no.

1816
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:00,291
Only Manjulika.

1817
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:03,541
Look who is here to fight you!

1818
02:00:04,375 --> 02:00:09,250
If you are a ghost, then we
too have a ghost of our own.

1819
02:00:09,333 --> 02:00:10,541
Uncle, please hear me out.

1820
02:00:10,625 --> 02:00:12,166
We don't have time for that, dear.

1821
02:00:12,375 --> 02:00:14,041
Now, actions must
speak louder than words.

1822
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:16,166
- Reet, quickly take over my body.
- Uncle?

1823
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,125
Possess my body.

1824
02:00:17,208 --> 02:00:18,226
- Uncle?
- She made Potlu fly.

1825
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:20,125
- I'll make her fly.
- Uncle! I am alive!

1826
02:00:29,458 --> 02:00:30,458
I am alive.

1827
02:00:30,875 --> 02:00:31,916
Since when?

1828
02:00:32,666 --> 02:00:33,708
From the beginning.

1829
02:00:37,125 --> 02:00:38,125
Ms. Manjulika?

1830
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:41,500
Look at the kids of this generation!
Just look at them!

1831
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:43,500
They make mistakes,

1832
02:00:43,708 --> 02:00:45,559
and elders have to bear
the consequences of their mistakes.

1833
02:00:45,583 --> 02:00:46,791
It's not fair!

1834
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,291
No! Don't, Ms. Manju!

1835
02:00:48,458 --> 02:00:49,708
Oh, God!

1836
02:00:51,125 --> 02:00:53,166
After so many years,
my time has finally come.

1837
02:00:54,416 --> 02:00:56,916
There was anger in my heart.

1838
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:00,291
There was a fire.

1839
02:01:00,708 --> 02:01:02,583
Now is the time.

1840
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,291
I've waited for so long.

1841
02:01:04,416 --> 02:01:06,208
Now is the time for revenge.

1842
02:01:06,625 --> 02:01:07,791
Now is the time.

1843
02:01:08,208 --> 02:01:09,208
Now,

1844
02:01:09,333 --> 02:01:11,583
everywhere, there will only be blood.

1845
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,916
This fire will be doused.

1846
02:01:14,625 --> 02:01:15,625
Father…

1847
02:01:16,875 --> 02:01:19,083
We need to get
the exorcist here at any cost.

1848
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:20,958
Only he can save us now.

1849
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:23,625
Hey. Tell me if I can
be of any help to you.

1850
02:01:24,583 --> 02:01:25,875
I am no stranger to you.

1851
02:01:26,666 --> 02:01:28,026
You want to get the exorcist here?

1852
02:01:28,666 --> 02:01:29,708
Baba!

1853
02:01:30,333 --> 02:01:31,375
Where are you, Baba?

1854
02:01:33,291 --> 02:01:34,291
Is he dead?

1855
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:42,958
He is gone.

1856
02:01:51,375 --> 02:01:52,375
Sorry.

1857
02:01:57,833 --> 02:01:59,250
Your savior is dead.

1858
02:02:00,958 --> 02:02:01,958
Now what?

1859
02:02:23,791 --> 02:02:24,666
Sister-in-law!

1860
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:25,750
Sister-in-law!

1861
02:02:27,375 --> 02:02:28,250
Ruhaan!

1862
02:02:28,333 --> 02:02:29,333
Ruhaan...

1863
02:02:29,791 --> 02:02:30,958
Ruhaan! Please, Ruhaan!

1864
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:32,291
She is my sister-in-law!

1865
02:02:34,791 --> 02:02:36,750
Ruhaan, I know that you can hear me.

1866
02:02:38,041 --> 02:02:39,458
Ruhaan, control yourself!

1867
02:02:40,166 --> 02:02:41,875
You can defeat Manjulika.

1868
02:02:41,958 --> 02:02:43,083
Please fight her!

1869
02:02:43,708 --> 02:02:44,791
Fight her, damn it!

1870
02:02:58,958 --> 02:03:00,375
Please, Ruhaan. Please, don't.

1871
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:02,958
Ruhaan, please.

1872
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:05,250
Ruhaan!

1873
02:03:05,833 --> 02:03:08,125
Take another step, Anjulika,

1874
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:10,375
and I'll slit Reet's throat!

1875
02:03:25,208 --> 02:03:26,208
Anjulika…

1876
02:03:27,083 --> 02:03:28,083
Or Manjulika?

1877
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:41,333
Leave if you wish to live.

1878
02:03:42,833 --> 02:03:44,291
And take Reet with you.

1879
02:03:46,958 --> 02:03:47,958
Leave!

1880
02:03:49,875 --> 02:03:50,875
Why did you save me?

1881
02:03:51,791 --> 02:03:52,791
Why did you save me?

1882
02:03:55,041 --> 02:03:56,041
Sister-in-law.

1883
02:04:05,458 --> 02:04:06,458
Thakur Saab…

1884
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:10,103
She is not Anjulika. She is Manjulika.

1885
02:04:18,916 --> 02:04:21,000
Your daughter-in-law has
been dead for 18 years now.

1886
02:06:34,125 --> 02:06:35,125
Manjulika!

1887
02:06:35,791 --> 02:06:37,125
Manjulika! What are you doing?

1888
02:06:37,208 --> 02:06:38,291
Manjulika!

1889
02:06:38,416 --> 02:06:39,416
Manjulika!

1890
02:06:39,833 --> 02:06:41,541
Manjulika, stop it!

1891
02:07:42,291 --> 02:07:44,166
Brother had found out the truth,

1892
02:07:44,958 --> 02:07:47,250
but before he could tell anyone else…

1893
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Manjulika?

1894
02:07:56,083 --> 02:07:57,083
Yes?

1895
02:08:23,583 --> 02:08:26,208
Sister-in-law, why didn't you
do anything after being set free?

1896
02:08:36,666 --> 02:08:37,916
Kill me.

1897
02:08:38,416 --> 02:08:39,458
Come on, kill me.

1898
02:08:40,583 --> 02:08:41,958
But what will you tell everyone?

1899
02:08:42,916 --> 02:08:47,041
That the one who has been showering
them with her love for 18 years,

1900
02:08:47,125 --> 02:08:50,291
the one who has taken such
good care of them is Manjulika?

1901
02:08:50,791 --> 02:08:55,083
And you, the one who cruelly
killed me, is Anjulika?

1902
02:09:00,708 --> 02:09:02,083
Who will believe you?

1903
02:09:02,291 --> 02:09:04,125
They will hate you even more.

1904
02:09:05,708 --> 02:09:07,791
No one will ever learn the truth, Anju.

1905
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:11,125
You'll get your revenge if you kill me…

1906
02:09:12,583 --> 02:09:14,000
But you won't get your family back.

1907
02:09:16,750 --> 02:09:18,208
Go away. Let me sleep.

1908
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:29,416
Bloody devil!

1909
02:09:31,958 --> 02:09:35,166
Ruined all my efforts!

1910
02:09:37,375 --> 02:09:38,375
Hey, gimpy!

1911
02:09:40,083 --> 02:09:41,791
Why did you choose her over me?

1912
02:09:44,708 --> 02:09:46,125
We had the same face.

1913
02:09:46,666 --> 02:09:47,833
Everything was the same.

1914
02:09:48,416 --> 02:09:49,416
Then why?

1915
02:09:54,166 --> 02:09:55,750
Destiny.

1916
02:09:58,083 --> 02:09:59,500
She was very lucky.

1917
02:10:03,375 --> 02:10:04,500
That's why I stole…

1918
02:10:05,083 --> 02:10:06,791
Her destiny from her.

1919
02:10:09,041 --> 02:10:13,458
I spent so many years as Anjulika.

1920
02:10:18,541 --> 02:10:19,791
Anjulika!

1921
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:24,750
While she…

1922
02:10:26,833 --> 02:10:28,666
Haunted this house.

1923
02:10:33,666 --> 02:10:35,541
No one even realized it.

1924
02:10:36,291 --> 02:10:37,291
Oh, no!

1925
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:38,541
What am I saying?

1926
02:10:39,666 --> 02:10:41,291
No, some people did realize it.

1927
02:10:48,750 --> 02:10:49,958
So…

1928
02:10:50,041 --> 02:10:51,333
I sent them…

1929
02:10:54,958 --> 02:10:56,208
To heaven.

1930
02:11:37,458 --> 02:11:38,458
Oh, no.

1931
02:11:38,791 --> 02:11:39,916
I am bleeding.

1932
02:13:10,541 --> 02:13:12,500
Father, please don't be upset with Reet.

1933
02:13:15,541 --> 02:13:18,625
The truth wouldn't have
come out if she hadn't lied.

1934
02:13:21,041 --> 02:13:22,125
Sorry, Dad.

1935
02:13:28,291 --> 02:13:29,291
Ruhaan?

1936
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:33,000
You understood my pain
when no one else could.

1937
02:13:34,916 --> 02:13:37,916
Thanks to you, I got a chance
to meet my family today.

1938
02:13:39,166 --> 02:13:40,041
Thank you.

1939
02:13:40,125 --> 02:13:42,458
Sister-in-law,
you don't need to thank me.

1940
02:13:43,125 --> 02:13:44,166
I am Rooh Baba.

1941
02:13:44,833 --> 02:13:49,041
It is my job to help spirits
communicate with their family.

1942
02:13:50,583 --> 02:13:51,708
You know that, don't you?

1943
02:13:55,041 --> 02:13:56,041
Open the door!

1944
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:57,541
Get me out of here!

1945
02:13:59,250 --> 02:14:00,291
I said get me out of here!

1946
02:14:02,125 --> 02:14:03,500
All of you should leave now.

1947
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,291
The conversation between
us sisters is incomplete.

1948
02:14:08,375 --> 02:14:10,000
Yes. Let's leave.

1949
02:14:29,666 --> 02:14:31,250
Anju, please forgive me.

1950
02:14:32,125 --> 02:14:33,208
I am your sister.
